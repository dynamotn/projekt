# @brief Utilities for process locking and coordination
# @description
#   This module provides a portable file lock (Linux/macOS) built on the
#   atomicity of `mkdir`, so it works the same way without depending on
#   `flock`, which isn't shipped by default on macOS.
#
#   A lock is a directory containing metadata about the process holding it
#   (pid, hostname, command, and acquisition time), which lets callers:
#
#   - prevent two runs of the same script from executing concurrently
#   - wait for a lock with a timeout instead of failing immediately
#   - inspect which process currently holds a lock
#   - detect and reclaim stale locks left behind by a dead process
# @usage
#   ### Prevent concurrent runs of the same script
#
#   ```bash
#   dybatpho::lock_acquire "$(basename "$0")" || dybatpho::die "Already running"
#   trap 'dybatpho::lock_release "$(basename "$0")"' EXIT
#   ```
#
#   ### Wait up to 30s for a lock, then run a command while holding it
#
#   ```bash
#   dybatpho::with_lock "deploy" 30 -- ./deploy.sh
#   ```
#
#   ### Inspect who is holding a lock
#
#   ```bash
#   dybatpho::lock_info "deploy"
#   ```
# @see
#   - `example/lock_ops.sh`
