## ✨ Overview

This module answers three questions a portable installer script keeps
asking:


- which package manager does this machine use (`dybatpho::pkg_manager`);
- is a dependency already there (`dybatpho::pkg_installed`,
  `dybatpho::pkg_missing`);
- how do I install it here without surprising the user
  (`dybatpho::pkg_install`, `dybatpho::pkg_ensure`,
  `dybatpho::pkg_require`).


Six managers are supported: `apt`, `brew`, `apk`, `dnf`, `pacman`, and
`emerge`. Detection prefers the platform's native manager, so a Linux box
with Homebrew installed still reports its distribution manager, and
`DYBATPHO_PKG_MANAGER` overrides the detection outright.


Because the same dependency is named differently on every distribution, the
install helpers accept `<manager>:<package>` overrides: `fd` is `fd-find` on
Debian, `fd` everywhere else, and `dybatpho::pkg_require fd apt:fd-find`
says exactly that.


A manager flag that this module does not model - `--cask` for Homebrew,
`--no-cache` for `apk`, `--no-install-recommends` for `apt-get` - is passed
through with `--arg`, once per flag, and lands right before the package
names.


Nothing here changes the system without saying so first. Every mutating
function asks for confirmation unless `--force`/`DYBATPHO_FORCE` is set,
refuses rather than guessing in a non-interactive shell, and prints the
command instead of running it under `--dry-run` or `DRY_RUN`.

| **`DYBATPHO_PKG_ASSUME_YES`** | bool | Set to `false` to drop the manager's non-interactive flags |

## 🚀 Usage

### Report the machine's package manager


```bash
dybatpho::pkg_manager   # apt, brew, apk, dnf, pacman or emerge
```


### Install only what is missing, unattended


```bash
dybatpho::pkg_ensure --force curl jq
```


### Make sure a command exists, whatever the distribution calls it


```bash
dybatpho::pkg_require fd apt:fd-find emerge:sys-apps/fd
```


### Show what would happen without touching the system


```bash
dybatpho::pkg_install --dry-run ripgrep
```


### Pass a flag the manager understands but this module does not


```bash
dybatpho::pkg_install --force --arg --cask -- firefox
dybatpho::pkg_install --force --arg --no-cache --arg --no-interactive -- curl
```

## 💡 Tips

- Run an installer with `--dry-run` first, then with `--force` from CI, and the same script covers both the review and the unattended run.

### `dybatpho::pkg_install`

- An `--arg` belongs to the install command alone: the `--update` refresh that may run before it is never given the extra arguments.
