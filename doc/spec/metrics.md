# Feature Specification: Script Measurement and Prometheus Export

**Feature Branch**: `[feature-metrics]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: `src/metrics.sh`, `test/metrics.bats`, `doc/metrics.md`, `example/metrics_ops.sh`, and the instrumentation hooks in `src/helpers.sh`, `src/logging.sh`, and `src/network.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

A script that runs unattended, in CI or from cron, leaves nothing behind that answers how long it took, how often it had to retry, or how many errors it hit. Operators learn about a backup that grew from two minutes to forty only when it starts overlapping the next run. Adding measurement by hand means capturing timestamps, subtracting them in a shell that has no floating point arithmetic, and hand-assembling an exposition format whose escaping and bucket rules are easy to get wrong.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Turn a script's behavior into data an existing monitoring stack can alert on.
- Make a slow step visible as a trend rather than as an incident.
- Record retries and errors that a script currently logs and forgets.
- Keep the measurement inside the library, so a script does not hand-assemble an exposition format.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Measure how long a step takes (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want to time a command so that I can see when a step starts getting slower.

**Why this priority**: Duration is the measurement most often missing, and the one that turns an incident into a trend.

**Independent Test**: Time a command that sleeps, then verify a duration was recorded and the command's exit code was passed through unchanged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command to run, **When** it is wrapped by the timing helper, **Then** its duration is recorded and its exit code is returned to the caller
2. **Given** a command that fails, **When** it is wrapped, **Then** the duration is still recorded and a failure counter is incremented
3. **Given** a region of a script rather than one command, **When** a timer is started and stopped around it, **Then** the elapsed time is recorded and published in a variable
4. **Given** a caller that captures the timing helper's output with a command substitution, **When** the call runs in that subshell, **Then** no measurement is silently lost, because the elapsed time is published in a variable rather than printed

---

### User Story 2 - Count what the script did and what went wrong (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want counters for work done and errors hit so that a dashboard can show a success rate.

**Why this priority**: A duration without an error rate hides the runs that failed fast.

**Independent Test**: Increment counters with and without labels, set a gauge, and read each back.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a counter, **When** it is incremented repeatedly, **Then** the recorded value is the sum of the increments
2. **Given** two label sets for the same metric, **When** each is incremented, **Then** they are kept as separate series
3. **Given** the same labels passed in a different order, **When** each call records, **Then** both land in one series
4. **Given** a gauge, **When** it is set twice, **Then** the second value replaces the first

---

### User Story 3 - Get retries, HTTP latency and errors without asking (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want the library to record what it already knows so that I do not have to instrument every retry and request myself.

**Why this priority**: The library is the only place that can see a retry loop or an HTTP status; a caller would have to reimplement the loop to measure it.

**Independent Test**: With the module loaded, exhaust a retry, log an error, and issue a mocked HTTP request, then verify each was counted without any explicit metric call.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the metrics module is loaded, **When** a retried command runs out of attempts, **Then** both the attempts and the exhaustion are counted
2. **Given** an HTTP request, **When** it completes, **Then** its total duration including retries and its final status are recorded
3. **Given** a logged message, **When** it passes the level filter, **Then** it is counted under its level
4. **Given** the metrics module is not loaded, **When** the same code paths run, **Then** they behave exactly as before and raise no error

---

### User Story 4 - Export to Prometheus (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want the recorded metrics in a file my collector already reads so that no new transport is needed.

**Why this priority**: Measurement that cannot be scraped changes nothing operationally.

**Independent Test**: Record metrics of each kind, render them, and verify the output is the Prometheus text exposition format with correct types, escaping, and cumulative buckets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** recorded metrics, **When** they are rendered, **Then** each carries a `# HELP` and `# TYPE` line and its series, in a stable order
2. **Given** a histogram, **When** it is rendered, **Then** buckets are cumulative, durations appear in seconds, and `_sum`, `_count`, and a `+Inf` bucket are present
3. **Given** a label value containing a quote or a backslash, **When** it is rendered, **Then** it is escaped as the format requires
4. **Given** a destination file, **When** the metrics are written, **Then** the file appears complete or not at all, because a collector may scrape it at any moment

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
. dybatpho/init.sh --modules metrics

dybatpho::metrics_time backup_duration_seconds target=db -- pg_dump -Fc mydb -f /backup/db.dump
dybatpho::metrics_gauge_set backup_size_bytes "$(dybatpho::file_size /backup/db.dump)"
dybatpho::metrics_write /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector/backup.prom
```

## Edge Cases

- A metric or label name that Prometheus would reject.
- A label value containing a quote, a backslash, or a newline.
- The same labels supplied in a different order on two calls.
- A timer stopped without being started.
- A duration longer than every bucket bound, which belongs only in `+Inf`.
- A metric described but never given a sample.
- Nothing recorded at all, so there is nothing to export.
- An ERR trap installed by `dybatpho::register_common_handlers` while rendering.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The module MUST record counters, gauges, and duration histograms in the current shell, and MUST NOT send anything anywhere.
- **FR-002**: The module MUST reject a metric or label name that is not a valid Prometheus name, and a counter amount or histogram observation that is not a non-negative integer.
- **FR-003**: Validation MUST stop the caller from recording the series, and therefore MUST NOT be performed inside a command substitution, where a rejection could not reach the caller.
- **FR-004**: Series MUST be identified by their metric name and label set, with labels ordered so that the same set recorded in a different order is one series.
- **FR-005**: Label values MUST be escaped for backslash, double quote, and newline.
- **FR-006**: Durations MUST be taken in whole milliseconds and exported in seconds, because Bash has no floating point arithmetic and Prometheus expects seconds.
- **FR-007**: Histogram buckets MUST be cumulative, MUST be configurable, and MUST include a `+Inf` bucket, a `_sum`, and a `_count`.
- **FR-008**: The timing helpers MUST publish the elapsed time in a variable rather than on standard output, so that capturing the result cannot discard the recording through a subshell.
- **FR-009**: The command timing helper MUST return the command's exit code unchanged, MUST record the duration whether it succeeded or failed, and MUST count a failure separately.
- **FR-010**: Rendering MUST produce the Prometheus text exposition format with `# HELP` and `# TYPE` lines, in an order that does not change between runs with the same data.
- **FR-011**: A metric that has been described but never sampled MUST NOT appear in the output.
- **FR-012**: Writing the metrics to a file MUST be atomic, because a collector may read the file at any moment.
- **FR-013**: Loading the module MUST activate the retry, HTTP, and logging instrumentation without any further call.
- **FR-014**: The instrumented modules MUST behave exactly as before when the module is not loaded, and MUST NOT depend on it.
- **FR-015**: Rendering MUST succeed under `set -e` and an ERR trap.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Series**: One metric name with one label set, the unit that carries a value.
- **Counter**: A value that only grows, such as a request or error count.
- **Gauge**: A value that can move in either direction, such as a queue depth.
- **Histogram**: A set of cumulative duration buckets with a sum and a count.
- **Exposition**: The rendered text a Prometheus collector reads.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A script records a step's duration with one call that does not change what the script does.
- **SC-002**: Retries, HTTP latency, and logged errors are recorded without the script instrumenting them.
- **SC-003**: The exported file is accepted by a Prometheus collector as valid exposition text.
- **SC-004**: A collector never reads a partially written metrics file.
- **SC-005**: A script that does not load the module is unaffected in behavior.

## Integration Tests *(mandatory)*

- **IT-001**: Increment counters with and without labels, in different label orders, and verify the recorded values and series.
- **IT-002**: Set a gauge twice, including a negative and a fractional value, and verify the last value wins.
- **IT-003**: Reject an invalid metric name, an invalid label name, a malformed label, and a non-integer amount, and verify nothing is recorded.
- **IT-004**: Observe durations that fall in different buckets and verify cumulative counts, `_sum`, `_count`, and `+Inf`.
- **IT-005**: Verify that milliseconds are rendered as seconds with three decimal places.
- **IT-006**: Start and stop a timer and verify the recording survives and the elapsed time is published in a variable.
- **IT-007**: Stop a timer that was never started and verify the failure.
- **IT-008**: Time a succeeding and a failing command and verify the duration, the failure counter, and the propagated exit code.
- **IT-009**: Verify the rendered output's `# HELP` and `# TYPE` lines, ordering, and label escaping.
- **IT-010**: Verify that nothing recorded renders nothing, and that a described but unsampled metric stays out of the output.
- **IT-011**: Write metrics to a file and verify the content and that no staging file is left behind.
- **IT-012**: Exhaust a retry, log errors, and issue a mocked HTTP request, and verify each was counted automatically.
- **IT-013**: Render under `dybatpho::register_common_handlers` and verify no ERR trap fires.

## Acceptance Criteria *(mandatory)*

1. Measurement is opt-in by loading the module, and free of effect when it is not loaded.
2. The exported text is valid Prometheus exposition format.
3. A script's behavior and exit codes are unchanged by measuring it.
