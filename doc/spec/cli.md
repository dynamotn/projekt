# Feature Specification: Declarative CLI Generation

**Feature Branch**: `[reverse-spec-cli]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/cli.sh`, `doc/cli.md`, `test/cli.bats`, `example/cli_basic.sh`, `example/cli_advanced.sh`, and `example/cli_ux.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Building non-trivial Bash CLIs by hand requires repetitive parsing, help rendering, subcommand dispatch, validation, and error handling code. This makes advanced CLIs hard to maintain and easy to break.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Allow shell CLIs to be declared from compact specs rather than hand-written parsers.
- Keep parsing, help output, and command behavior aligned from one source of truth.
- Bring Cobra-like ergonomics to Bash scripts without external parser code generation tools.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Define a command declaratively (Priority: P1)

As a CLI author, I want to describe flags, params, subcommands, and actions in shell spec functions so that the library can generate the parser for me.

**Why this priority**: Spec-driven parsing is the core differentiator of this module.

**Independent Test**: Define a root command and subcommands with `dybatpho::opts::*`, then verify parsing and action dispatch from the generated parser.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a spec defines options and a root action, **When** the generated parser receives valid input, **Then** variables are initialized, options are parsed, and the configured action runs
2. **Given** a spec defines nested subcommands, **When** the parser receives a subcommand path, **Then** dispatch transfers control to the matching child spec

---

### User Story 2 - Expose discoverable CLI help (Priority: P1)

As an end user, I want automatically generated help text so that I can understand commands, options, aliases, and required inputs without reading source code.

**Why this priority**: Help output is the user-facing contract of a CLI and must stay synchronized with parsing rules.

**Independent Test**: Generate help at the root and nested-command level and verify usage, descriptions, options, commands, aliases, hidden items, and required markers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command exposes visible options and subcommands, **When** help is requested, **Then** usage and readable sections are rendered from the spec
2. **Given** a spec marks items as hidden or deprecated, **When** help is requested, **Then** hidden items are omitted and deprecated items are annotated

---

### User Story 3 - Enforce richer command contracts (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want positional argument validation, aliases, persistent options, hidden and deprecated items, and lifecycle hooks so that Bash CLIs can support more advanced usage patterns.

**Why this priority**: These richer contracts make the generated CLI practical for larger real-world scripts.

**Independent Test**: Use named and raw argument rules, aliases, persistent options, and pre/post-run hooks in a nested command tree and verify each behavior works from the generated parser.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command declares argument-count rules, **When** the parser receives too few or too many positional arguments, **Then** a standardized argument-count failure is reported
2. **Given** a command declares `prerun`, `action`, and `postrun`, **When** parsing succeeds, **Then** the three lifecycle steps run in the configured order for the active command only

---

### User Story 4 - Provide interactive and shell-native UX (Priority: P1)

As a CLI author, I want missing values to be requested interactively and command
names/options to be discoverable through shell completion so that generated
CLIs are approachable for both interactive users and automation.

**Why this priority**: Prompting and completion reduce input errors without
requiring each CLI to implement shell-specific integration code.

**Independent Test**: Define prompted, constrained, and multi-value parameters,
generate completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish, and verify the generated
artifacts expose the declared options and commands.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a parameter declares a prompt and is not supplied, **When** the
   command runs interactively, **Then** the user is prompted and the entered
   value is passed to the action
2. **Given** a parameter declares `choices`, **When** the user enters an
   invalid value, **Then** the prompt rejects it and requests another value
3. **Given** a parameter declares `multiple:true`, **When** the user selects
   multiple values using comma-separated values or a numeric range such as
   `1-3`, **Then** the action receives the selected values in order
4. **Given** a CLI spec contains options and subcommands, **When** completion is
   generated for Bash, Zsh, or Fish, **Then** the output contains the visible
   switches and command names for that shell
5. **Given** an application needs a standalone prompt or selection list,
   **When** `dybatpho::prompt` or `dybatpho::select` runs, **Then** it reads
   interactive input and returns the selected value according to its choices
   and default behavior

---

### User Story 5 - Reuse option metadata outside parsing (Priority: P2)

As a CLI maintainer, I want environment-variable defaults and generated schema
and man pages to come from the same spec so that runtime behavior and external
documentation cannot drift apart.

**Why this priority**: Shared metadata makes CLIs easier to deploy, document,
and integrate with tooling.

**Independent Test**: Define an option with `env`, `required`, aliases, and
description metadata, then verify environment fallback, JSON schema output, and
roff man-page output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an option declares `env:NAME` and no command-line value is
   provided, **When** parsing starts, **Then** the option variable is initialized
   from `NAME`
2. **Given** both an environment value and a command-line value are present,
   **When** parsing starts, **Then** the explicit command-line value takes
   precedence
3. **Given** a CLI spec is passed to schema generation, **When** JSON is
   generated, **Then** it includes command descriptions, options, switches,
   environment names, choices, prompts, and required/hidden metadata
4. **Given** a CLI spec is passed to man-page generation, **When** roff is
   generated, **Then** it documents visible options, required markers,
   environment variables, and subcommands

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
function _run_deploy {
  dybatpho::info "Deploying ${COMPONENT} to ${ENVIRONMENT}"
}

function _spec {
  dybatpho::opts::setup "Deployment tool" ARGS action:"_run_deploy"
  dybatpho::opts::param "Target environment" ENVIRONMENT -e --env \
    choices:dev,staging,prod required:true
  dybatpho::opts::param "Component to deploy" COMPONENT --component \
    env:DEPLOY_COMPONENT init:="api"
  dybatpho::opts::flag "Verbose output" VERBOSE -v --verbose
  dybatpho::opts::disp "Show help" --help action:"dybatpho::generate_help _spec"
}

# One spec drives parsing, help, completions, schema, and the man page.
dybatpho::generate_from_spec _spec "$@"
dybatpho::generate_completion _spec bash mytool
dybatpho::generate_schema _spec mytool
dybatpho::generate_man _spec mytool
```

## Edge Cases

- A user passes an unrecognized option, a forbidden argument, or an invalid subcommand.
- A parameter is required but omitted.
- A spec uses aliases, hidden items, deprecated items, persistent parent options, and nested command paths simultaneously.
- A prompt receives EOF or an empty value without a default.
- A choice list contains multiple values and the user enters a mixture of names
  and numeric selections.
- A multi-value prompt receives an invalid, descending, or out-of-range numeric
  range.
- An environment variable is configured with an invalid shell identifier.
- Completion generation is requested for an unsupported shell.
- Schema or man-page metadata contains quotes, backslashes, or newlines.
- A standalone prompt or selection helper receives EOF or an invalid choice.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The module MUST allow command specs to declare setup behavior, flags, params, display options, and subcommands using shell functions.
- **FR-002**: The generated parser MUST initialize variables, parse options, validate input, and dispatch to the correct action or subcommand.
- **FR-003**: The module MUST generate human-readable help output from the same spec data used for parsing.
- **FR-004**: The module MUST support positional argument validation using raw and Cobra-style rule names.
- **FR-005**: The module MUST support aliases, persistent options, hidden items, deprecated items, custom labels, and required parameters.
- **FR-006**: The module MUST support command lifecycle hooks that run before and after the main action when parsing succeeds.
- **FR-007**: The module MUST emit standardized error messages for invalid command-line input.
- **FR-008**: The module MUST allow debug inspection of generated parser output through the documented debug toggle.
- **FR-009**: The module MUST support interactive prompts for missing parameter values, including optional defaults.
- **FR-010**: The module MUST support constrained choices and multi-value
  selection for parameters and provide standalone prompt and choice-selection
  helpers, including validation of named or numbered choices.
- **FR-011**: The module MUST generate completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish from the CLI spec.
- **FR-012**: The module MUST allow options to declare an environment variable fallback using `env:NAME`.
- **FR-013**: Explicit command-line values MUST take precedence over environment-variable fallbacks.
- **FR-014**: The module MUST generate a machine-readable JSON schema from the same CLI spec.
- **FR-015**: The module MUST generate a roff man page from the same CLI spec.
- **FR-016**: Generated schema and man-page output MUST preserve relevant option and command metadata, including descriptions, aliases, visibility, required state, choices, prompts, and environment names.
- **FR-017**: The CLI spec documentation MUST describe the `env:`, `prompt:`, `choices:`, and `multiple:` option attributes and their supported scope.
- **FR-018**: The option DSL MUST support setup, flag, parameter, display, and
  child-command declarations through `dybatpho::opts::*`.
- **FR-019**: `opts::validate_choice` MUST accept only declared choice names
  and reject values outside the declared set; `select` MUST additionally
  support numeric selections and ascending ranges in multi-select mode.
- **FR-020**: An unrecognized option or invalid command MUST be reported with
  the closest accepted switch or command name when one is near enough by
  Levenshtein distance, comparing with leading dashes ignored.
- **FR-021**: A command that declares at least one switch MUST reject an
  unmatched `-x` or `--xy` instead of collecting it as a positional argument;
  `--` MUST remain the way to pass dashed values through, and a command that
  declares no switches MUST keep collecting them.
- **FR-022**: `negatable:true` MUST generate a `--no-<name>` switch for every
  long switch and alias of a flag, and MUST default the off value to `false`
  when no `off:` is declared.
- **FR-023**: `count:true` MUST record how many times a flag appeared rather
  than a value, starting from `0`, so that repeated and clustered forms such as
  `-v -v` and `-vv` both yield `2`.
- **FR-024**: `config:<key>` MUST bind an option to a configuration key loaded
  by `src/config.sh`, and the resolved precedence MUST be
  flag > `env:` > `config:` > `init:`.
- **FR-025**: `dybatpho::opts::arg` MUST document positional arguments for the
  usage line, help, schema, and man page, and MUST derive the `args:<rule>`
  count check when the spec declares no explicit rule.
- **FR-026**: Generated help MUST follow conventional command-line layout: a
  usage line naming `COMMAND` only when subcommands exist, then `Arguments`,
  `Commands`, and `Options` sections aligned to one shared column, with
  per-option `env`, `config`, `choices`, `default`, and repeatability
  annotations and the automatic `-h, --help` row.
- **FR-027**: `dybatpho::generate_completion` MUST cache its output keyed by a
  hash of the script declaring the spec, and MUST bypass the cache when
  `DYBATPHO_CLI_CACHE` is false or the declaring script cannot be read.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **CLI Spec**: A shell function that describes one command level through `dybatpho::opts::*` calls.
- **Generated Parser**: The runtime shell logic emitted from a CLI spec to parse and dispatch user input.
- **Help Row**: A rendered option or command entry derived from spec metadata.
- **Option Metadata**: The shared description of a flag or parameter, including switches, aliases, environment fallback, choices, prompt behavior, visibility, and required state.
- **Completion Artifact**: A shell-specific Bash, Zsh, or Fish script generated from command and option metadata.
- **CLI Schema**: A JSON representation of the command tree and option metadata.
- **Man Page**: A roff reference document generated from the command tree and visible option metadata.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A CLI author can express advanced command trees without maintaining a separate manual parser.
- **SC-002**: Help output stays synchronized with command behavior because both derive from the same spec.
- **SC-003**: Nested command trees support advanced metadata such as aliases, persistence, deprecation, and hooks without custom parsing code.
- **SC-004**: A single spec can produce usable Bash, Zsh, and Fish completion artifacts without manually duplicating option names.
- **SC-005**: Deployments can configure options through declared environment variables while preserving explicit CLI overrides.
- **SC-006**: The same spec can produce valid JSON schema and roff man-page artifacts that describe the exposed CLI.
- **SC-007**: A mistyped switch or command is answered with the correction instead of a bare rejection, so the user does not have to re-read the help to find the name they meant.
- **SC-008**: One precedence chain — flag, environment, configuration file, default — covers every bound option, so a CLI no longer wires configuration into options by hand.
- **SC-009**: Generated help reads like a conventional command-line tool, with the accepted arguments and the source of every option value visible without consulting the source.

## Integration Tests *(mandatory)*

- **IT-001**: Generate a parser from a nested root spec and verify valid command paths dispatch to the expected actions.
- **IT-002**: Request help at the root and child-command levels and verify usage, options, commands, aliases, and visibility rules.
- **IT-003**: Exercise named argument validators, persistent options, deprecated items, and lifecycle hooks in one CLI tree and verify the resulting behavior.
- **IT-004**: Generate Bash, Zsh, and Fish completion for a spec and verify visible options, aliases, and subcommands are present.
- **IT-005**: Run a spec with `env:NAME`, a prompted parameter, choices, and `multiple:true`; verify environment fallback, prompt selection, and explicit option precedence.
- **IT-006**: Generate schema and man-page artifacts from one spec and verify valid JSON plus documented options, environment names, and subcommands.
- **IT-007**: Pass a mistyped switch and a mistyped command to a spec that declares both, and verify each error names the closest accepted alternative and stays silent when nothing is close.
- **IT-008**: Declare a `negatable:true` flag and a `count:true` flag, and verify `--no-` turns the flag off while repeated and clustered short forms accumulate.
- **IT-009**: Bind an option with both `env:` and `config:`, and verify the resolved value follows flag > environment > configuration > default.
- **IT-010**: Declare positional arguments and verify the usage line, the `Arguments` section, the derived count rule, and the schema and man-page entries all describe them.
- **IT-011**: Generate completion twice for one spec and verify the second run reuses the cached artifact, and that disabling the cache writes nothing.

## Acceptance Criteria *(mandatory)*

1. The CLI module provides a credible declarative alternative to hand-written Bash argument parsing.
2. Advanced features remain accessible through the same `dybatpho::opts::*` DSL instead of requiring separate extension APIs.
3. Completion, interactive input, environment configuration, schema, and man-page output are all derived from the same CLI spec.
