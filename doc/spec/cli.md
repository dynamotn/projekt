# Feature Specification: Declarative CLI Generation

**Feature Branch**: `[reverse-spec-cli]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/cli.sh`, `doc/cli.md`, `test/cli.bats`, `example/cli_basic.sh`, `example/cli_advanced.sh`, and `example/cli_ux.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Building non-trivial Bash CLIs by hand requires repetitive parsing, help rendering, subcommand dispatch, validation, and error handling code. This makes advanced CLIs hard to maintain and easy to break.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Allow shell CLIs to be declared from compact specs rather than hand-written parsers.
- Keep parsing, help output, and command behavior aligned from one source of truth.
- Bring Cobra-like ergonomics to Bash scripts without external parser code generation tools.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Define a command declaratively (Priority: P1)

As a CLI author, I want to describe flags, params, subcommands, and actions in shell spec functions so that the library can generate the parser for me.

**Why this priority**: Spec-driven parsing is the core differentiator of this module.

**Independent Test**: Define a root command and subcommands with `dybatpho::opts::*`, then verify parsing and action dispatch from the generated parser.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a spec defines options and a root action, **When** the generated parser receives valid input, **Then** variables are initialized, options are parsed, and the configured action runs
2. **Given** a spec defines nested subcommands, **When** the parser receives a subcommand path, **Then** dispatch transfers control to the matching child spec

---

### User Story 2 - Expose discoverable CLI help (Priority: P1)

As an end user, I want automatically generated help text so that I can understand commands, options, aliases, and required inputs without reading source code.

**Why this priority**: Help output is the user-facing contract of a CLI and must stay synchronized with parsing rules.

**Independent Test**: Generate help at the root and nested-command level and verify usage, descriptions, options, commands, aliases, hidden items, and required markers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command exposes visible options and subcommands, **When** help is requested, **Then** usage and readable sections are rendered from the spec
2. **Given** a spec marks items as hidden or deprecated, **When** help is requested, **Then** hidden items are omitted and deprecated items are annotated

---

### User Story 3 - Enforce richer command contracts (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want positional argument validation, aliases, persistent options, hidden and deprecated items, and lifecycle hooks so that Bash CLIs can support more advanced usage patterns.

**Why this priority**: These richer contracts make the generated CLI practical for larger real-world scripts.

**Independent Test**: Use named and raw argument rules, aliases, persistent options, and pre/post-run hooks in a nested command tree and verify each behavior works from the generated parser.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command declares argument-count rules, **When** the parser receives too few or too many positional arguments, **Then** a standardized argument-count failure is reported
2. **Given** a command declares `prerun`, `action`, and `postrun`, **When** parsing succeeds, **Then** the three lifecycle steps run in the configured order for the active command only

---

### User Story 4 - Provide interactive and shell-native UX (Priority: P1)

As a CLI author, I want missing values to be requested interactively and command
names/options to be discoverable through shell completion so that generated
CLIs are approachable for both interactive users and automation.

**Why this priority**: Prompting and completion reduce input errors without
requiring each CLI to implement shell-specific integration code.

**Independent Test**: Define prompted, constrained, and multi-value parameters,
generate completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish, and verify the generated
artifacts expose the declared options and commands.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a parameter declares a prompt and is not supplied, **When** the
   command runs interactively, **Then** the user is prompted and the entered
   value is passed to the action
2. **Given** a parameter declares `choices`, **When** the user enters an
   invalid value, **Then** the prompt rejects it and requests another value
3. **Given** a parameter declares `multiple:true`, **When** the user selects
   multiple values using comma-separated values or a numeric range such as
   `1-3`, **Then** the action receives the selected values in order
4. **Given** a CLI spec contains options and subcommands, **When** completion is
   generated for Bash, Zsh, or Fish, **Then** the output contains the visible
   switches and command names for that shell
5. **Given** an application needs a standalone prompt or selection list,
   **When** `dybatpho::prompt` or `dybatpho::select` runs, **Then** it reads
   interactive input and returns the selected value according to its choices
   and default behavior

---

### User Story 5 - Reuse option metadata outside parsing (Priority: P2)

As a CLI maintainer, I want environment-variable defaults and generated schema
and man pages to come from the same spec so that runtime behavior and external
documentation cannot drift apart.

**Why this priority**: Shared metadata makes CLIs easier to deploy, document,
and integrate with tooling.

**Independent Test**: Define an option with `env`, `required`, aliases, and
description metadata, then verify environment fallback, JSON schema output, and
roff man-page output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an option declares `env:NAME` and no command-line value is
   provided, **When** parsing starts, **Then** the option variable is initialized
   from `NAME`
2. **Given** both an environment value and a command-line value are present,
   **When** parsing starts, **Then** the explicit command-line value takes
   precedence
3. **Given** a CLI spec is passed to schema generation, **When** JSON is
   generated, **Then** it includes command descriptions, options, switches,
   environment names, choices, prompts, and required/hidden metadata
4. **Given** a CLI spec is passed to man-page generation, **When** roff is
   generated, **Then** it documents visible options, required markers,
   environment variables, and subcommands

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
function _run_deploy {
  dybatpho::info "Deploying ${COMPONENT} to ${ENVIRONMENT}"
}

function _spec {
  dybatpho::opts::setup "Deployment tool" ARGS action:"_run_deploy"
  dybatpho::opts::param "Target environment" ENVIRONMENT -e --env \
    choices:dev,staging,prod required:true
  dybatpho::opts::param "Component to deploy" COMPONENT --component \
    env:DEPLOY_COMPONENT init:="api"
  dybatpho::opts::flag "Verbose output" VERBOSE -v --verbose
  dybatpho::opts::disp "Show help" --help action:"dybatpho::generate_help _spec"
}

# One spec drives parsing, help, completions, schema, and the man page.
dybatpho::generate_from_spec _spec "$@"
dybatpho::generate_completion _spec bash mytool
dybatpho::generate_schema _spec mytool
dybatpho::generate_man _spec mytool
```

## Edge Cases

- A user passes an unrecognized option, a forbidden argument, or an invalid subcommand.
- A parameter is required but omitted.
- A spec uses aliases, hidden items, deprecated items, persistent parent options, and nested command paths simultaneously.
- A prompt receives EOF or an empty value without a default.
- A choice list contains multiple values and the user enters a mixture of names
  and numeric selections.
- A multi-value prompt receives an invalid, descending, or out-of-range numeric
  range.
- An environment variable is configured with an invalid shell identifier.
- Completion generation is requested for an unsupported shell.
- Schema or man-page metadata contains quotes, backslashes, or newlines.
- A standalone prompt or selection helper receives EOF or an invalid choice.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **CLI Spec**: A shell function that describes one command level through `dybatpho::opts::*` calls.
- **Generated Parser**: The runtime shell logic emitted from a CLI spec to parse and dispatch user input.
- **Help Row**: A rendered option or command entry derived from spec metadata.
- **Option Metadata**: The shared description of a flag or parameter, including switches, aliases, environment fallback, choices, prompt behavior, visibility, and required state.
- **Completion Artifact**: A shell-specific Bash, Zsh, or Fish script generated from command and option metadata.
- **CLI Schema**: A JSON representation of the command tree and option metadata.
- **Man Page**: A roff reference document generated from the command tree and visible option metadata.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A CLI author can express advanced command trees without maintaining a separate manual parser.
- **SC-002**: Help output stays synchronized with command behavior because both derive from the same spec.
- **SC-003**: Nested command trees support advanced metadata such as aliases, persistence, deprecation, and hooks without custom parsing code.
- **SC-004**: A single spec can produce usable Bash, Zsh, and Fish completion artifacts without manually duplicating option names.
- **SC-005**: Deployments can configure options through declared environment variables while preserving explicit CLI overrides.
- **SC-006**: The same spec can produce valid JSON schema and roff man-page artifacts that describe the exposed CLI.

## Integration Tests *(mandatory)*

- **IT-001**: Generate a parser from a nested root spec and verify valid command paths dispatch to the expected actions.
- **IT-002**: Request help at the root and child-command levels and verify usage, options, commands, aliases, and visibility rules.
- **IT-003**: Exercise named argument validators, persistent options, deprecated items, and lifecycle hooks in one CLI tree and verify the resulting behavior.
- **IT-004**: Generate Bash, Zsh, and Fish completion for a spec and verify visible options, aliases, and subcommands are present.
- **IT-005**: Run a spec with `env:NAME`, a prompted parameter, choices, and `multiple:true`; verify environment fallback, prompt selection, and explicit option precedence.
- **IT-006**: Generate schema and man-page artifacts from one spec and verify valid JSON plus documented options, environment names, and subcommands.

## Acceptance Criteria *(mandatory)*

1. The CLI module provides a credible declarative alternative to hand-written Bash argument parsing.
2. Advanced features remain accessible through the same `dybatpho::opts::*` DSL instead of requiring separate extension APIs.
3. Completion, interactive input, environment configuration, schema, and man-page output are all derived from the same CLI spec.
