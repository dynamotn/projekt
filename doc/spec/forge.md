# Feature Specification: Forge API Utilities

**Feature Branch**: `[feature-forge]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/forge.sh`, `doc/forge.md`, `test/forge.bats`, and `example/forge_ops.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

`git.sh` reads the repository on disk and `release.sh` builds, checksums and
signs artifacts, then stops. Nothing in the library publishes anything, so every
project that uses it ends up writing the same `curl` against the GitHub or
GitLab API: assembling the base URL, encoding the project path, choosing the
auth header, and remembering which forge calls a field `body` and which calls it
`description`.

Those differences are mechanical but unforgiving. A script written against
GitHub does not run against a company GitLab, and a script that reports a CI
failure by opening an issue opens a new one on every single run.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Close the gap between building a release and publishing it.
- Let one script work against GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab and self-hosted
  GitLab without branching on the forge.
- Make repeated automated reporting idempotent, so a scheduled job does not
  flood a tracker.
- Keep credentials out of logs by routing tokens through `secret.sh`.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Discover where the repository is hosted (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want the forge, project and API base derived from the Git
remote so that the same script runs wherever the repository lives.

**Independent Test**: Point a throwaway repository at a `git@`, `ssh://` and
`https://` remote on github.com, gitlab.com, a GitHub Enterprise host and a
self-hosted GitLab, and inspect the four detection functions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a remote in any of the three URL forms, **When** `forge_host` is
   called, **Then** the host is returned without scheme, credential or `.git`
2. **Given** a github.com remote, **When** `forge_api` is called, **Then**
   `https://api.github.com` is returned
3. **Given** any other GitHub host, **When** `forge_api` is called, **Then**
   `https://<host>/api/v3` is returned
4. **Given** a GitLab project nested in subgroups, **When** `forge_repo` is
   called, **Then** every path segment after the host is preserved
5. **Given** a host that matches neither forge, **When** `forge_kind` is called,
   **Then** it fails and names `DYBATPHO_FORGE` as the way to resolve it

### User Story 2 - Report a recurring failure once (Priority: P1)

As the author of a scheduled job, I want to report a failure to the tracker
without opening a duplicate issue on every run.

**Independent Test**: Call `forge_issue_report` twice against a stubbed forge
and confirm the first call creates while the second comments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no open issue carries the title, **When** `forge_issue_report` is
   called, **Then** an issue is created and the result reports `created`
2. **Given** an open issue carries the title, **When** `forge_issue_report` is
   called, **Then** a comment is added and the result reports `commented`
3. **Given** either outcome, **When** the call returns, **Then** stdout is a
   JSON object with `action`, `number` and `url`
4. **Given** an open issue titled `Build failing on macOS`, **When**
   `forge_issue_find "Build failing"` is called, **Then** it does not match

### User Story 3 - Publish a release and its artifacts (Priority: P1)

As a release script, I want to create the release for a tag and attach the
artifacts `release.sh` produced.

**Independent Test**: Create a release against a stubbed forge, then upload a
file to it, on both GitHub and GitLab.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tag, **When** `forge_release_create` is called, **Then** the
   release is created and its identifier is printed
2. **Given** a GitHub release, **When** `forge_release_upload` is called,
   **Then** the asset is sent to the upload host and its download URL is printed
3. **Given** a GitLab release, **When** `forge_release_upload` is called,
   **Then** the file is stored as a generic package and linked to the release
4. **Given** a tag with no release, **When** `forge_release_upload` is called,
   **Then** it fails and says the release must be created first

### Example Workflow

```bash
. dybatpho/init.sh --modules release forge
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_..."

version="$(dybatpho::release_next_version)"
dybatpho::release_package "dist" "v${version}" linux amd64
dybatpho::forge_release_create "v${version}" "v${version}" "$(dybatpho::release_changelog)"
dybatpho::forge_release_upload "v${version}" "dist/app-v${version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
```

## Edge Cases

- A remote URL carrying `user@host` must not leak the credential into the host.
- A remote URL with a trailing slash or `.git` suffix must normalize identically.
- A GitLab project path must be URL-encoded when it appears in an API path, and
  must not be encoded when it appears in a browser URL.
- `DYBATPHO_FORGE` set to anything other than `github` or `gitlab` is an error
  rather than a silent fallback.
- An issue title that is a prefix of another open issue's title must not match.
- A token registered inside a command substitution does not survive it; this is
  a property of Bash subshells and is documented rather than worked around.
- Every request honors `DRY_RUN`, so a publishing script can be rehearsed.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The module MUST detect the forge from the configured Git remote,
  and MUST let `DYBATPHO_FORGE` override detection.
- **FR-002**: The module MUST normalize `git@host:path`, `ssh://git@host/path`
  and `https://host/path` remotes to the same `host/owner/repo`.
- **FR-003**: `dybatpho::forge_api` MUST return `https://api.github.com` for
  github.com, `https://<host>/api/v3` for any other GitHub, and
  `https://<host>/api/v4` for GitLab, and MUST honor `DYBATPHO_FORGE_API`.
- **FR-004**: `dybatpho::forge_repo` MUST preserve nested GitLab group paths and
  MUST honor `DYBATPHO_FORGE_REPO`.
- **FR-005**: `dybatpho::forge_token` MUST prefer `DYBATPHO_FORGE_TOKEN`, then
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` or `GITLAB_TOKEN`/`CI_JOB_TOKEN` by forge, MUST
  register the token with `secret.sh`, and MUST name the variables to set when
  none is.
- **FR-006**: `dybatpho::forge_request` MUST resolve a project-relative path to
  a full API URL, MUST pass an absolute URL through unchanged, MUST send the
  auth header the forge expects, and MUST send a JSON content type only when a
  body is supplied.
- **FR-007**: The module MUST address a GitLab project by its URL-encoded path
  and a GitHub repository as `repos/owner/name`.
- **FR-008**: `dybatpho::forge_issue_find` MUST match a title exactly and MUST
  read `number` on GitHub and `iid` on GitLab.
- **FR-009**: `dybatpho::forge_issue_create` MUST send `body` on GitHub and
  `description` on GitLab, and MUST send labels as a JSON array on GitHub and as
  a comma-separated string on GitLab.
- **FR-010**: `dybatpho::forge_issue_report` MUST create when no open issue
  carries the title, MUST comment otherwise, and MUST print a JSON object with
  `action`, `number` and `url`.
- **FR-011a**: `dybatpho::forge_release_create` MUST accept a draft flag, MUST
  set `draft` on GitHub when it is given, MUST omit the field otherwise, and
  MUST fail on GitLab rather than publish a release that was asked to be a
  draft, because GitLab has no draft release.
- **FR-011**: `dybatpho::forge_release_find` MUST print the identifier the
  forge's own upload step needs: the numeric id on GitHub, the tag on GitLab.
- **FR-012**: `dybatpho::forge_release_upload` MUST refuse a missing file and a
  tag with no release, MUST send GitHub assets to the upload host, and MUST
  store GitLab assets as a generic package and then link them to the release.
- **FR-013**: Every failing request MUST fail the calling function with a
  message naming the operation and the HTTP status.
- **FR-014**: A failed request MUST report what the forge said about it, not
  only the HTTP status, so a bad field, an expired token and a rate limit are
  told apart. The status MUST still be included, because a body is not
  guaranteed to be present or to be JSON.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Forge kind**: `github` or `gitlab`; selects every path, field name and
  header that differs between the two.
- **Project identifier**: `owner/repo`, possibly with nested groups; encoded
  differently for API paths and browser URLs.
- **Issue report result**: JSON object with `action` (`created` or
  `commented`), `number` and `url`.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A script that publishes a release runs unchanged against GitHub,
  GitHub Enterprise, GitLab and self-hosted GitLab.
- **SC-002**: A scheduled job reporting the same failure repeatedly produces
  exactly one issue.
- **SC-003**: Detection produces the same `host/owner/repo` for all three remote
  URL forms of the same repository.
- **SC-004**: No function in the module writes a token to stdout, stderr or a
  log file.

## Integration Tests *(mandatory)*

- **IT-001**: `dybatpho::forge_host` reads the host out of every remote URL form.
- **IT-002**: `dybatpho::forge_kind` detects both forges and honors the override.
- **IT-003**: `dybatpho::forge_kind` rejects an override that names no forge.
- **IT-004**: `dybatpho::forge_repo` keeps nested GitLab groups and honors the override.
- **IT-005**: `dybatpho::forge_api` points at the right base for each forge.
- **IT-006**: `dybatpho::forge_token` prefers `DYBATPHO_FORGE_TOKEN` and falls back per forge.
- **IT-007**: `dybatpho::forge_token` names the variables to set when none is set.
- **IT-008**: `dybatpho::forge_token` registers in its own shell but not through a command substitution.
- **IT-009**: `dybatpho::forge_request` builds a GitHub URL and sends a bearer token.
- **IT-010**: `dybatpho::forge_request` URL-encodes the project path on GitLab.
- **IT-011**: `dybatpho::forge_request` sends a JSON body only when one is given.
- **IT-012**: `dybatpho::forge_request` passes an absolute URL through untouched.
- **IT-013**: `dybatpho::forge_issue_find` matches a title exactly, not by prefix.
- **IT-014**: `dybatpho::forge_issue_create` posts the field names and label shape of each forge.
- **IT-015**: `dybatpho::forge_issue_comment` posts to the endpoint each forge uses.
- **IT-016**: `dybatpho::forge_issue_report` creates when nothing is open and comments otherwise.
- **IT-017**: `dybatpho::forge_issue_url` points at the browser path of each forge.
- **IT-018**: `dybatpho::forge_release_find` returns the identifier each forge needs.
- **IT-019**: `dybatpho::forge_release_create` posts the field names of each forge.
- **IT-019a**: `dybatpho::forge_release_create` drafts on GitHub when asked, does not by default, and refuses on GitLab.
- **IT-020**: `dybatpho::forge_release_upload` sends the asset to the GitHub upload host.
- **IT-021**: `dybatpho::forge_release_upload` stores and links a GitLab generic package.
- **IT-022**: `dybatpho::forge_release_upload` refuses a missing file or a missing release.
- **IT-023**: Verify the forge's message and field-level detail are reported
  for a 422, for both forges' wordings, and that a missing or non-JSON body
  falls back to the status.

## Acceptance Criteria *(mandatory)*

- All functional requirements are implemented in `src/forge.sh`.
- Every integration test above corresponds to a case in `test/forge.bats`.
- `example/forge_ops.sh` runs offline, against a stubbed forge and a throwaway
  repository, and demonstrates every public function.
- `doc/forge.md` is generated from the source and documents every public
  function and environment variable.
