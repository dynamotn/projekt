# Feature Specification: Process Lifecycle, Traps, Cleanup, Dry Run, Timeouts, Background Jobs, and PID Files

**Feature Branch**: `[reverse-spec-process]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/process.sh`, `doc/process.md`, `test/process.bats`, and `example/process_ops.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Operational shell scripts need predictable exit behavior, signal handling, composable traps, deferred cleanup, and safe dry-run execution. Without a shared module, these concerns are typically reimplemented poorly and inconsistently.

They also need to bound how long a command may run, to start and supervise several long-running commands at once, and to record which process is serving so a second copy is not started. Until now the library only bounded a curl request, so every script that needed a general time limit reached for the `timeout` binary — which is absent on a stock macOS and cannot run a shell function — and hand-rolled its own process bookkeeping.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Make destructive or long-running scripts safer to run.
- Standardize error and signal handling across dybatpho-based scripts.
- Allow scripts to preview side effects before execution.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Handle errors and signals consistently (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want one-line registration of common handlers so that errors and interrupts are surfaced consistently without custom trap code.

**Why this priority**: Signal and error handling affect script safety and user trust.

**Independent Test**: Register common handlers, trigger a command failure or signal, and verify structured termination behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a script opts into the common handlers, **When** a command fails under the ERR trap, **Then** the error handler reports the failure and exits non-zero
2. **Given** a script receives SIGINT or SIGTERM, **When** the signal handler
   runs, **Then** the script reports the interruption and exits with the
   signal-specific status

---

### User Story 2 - Clean up temporary resources automatically (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want files and directories removed on shell exit so that temporary workspaces do not leak after the script finishes or aborts.

**Why this priority**: Deferred cleanup is a core safety feature used by the file module and many automation flows.

**Independent Test**: Register temporary paths for cleanup, exit the shell, and verify the paths are removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a script registers a temporary file for cleanup, **When** the shell exits normally, **Then** the temporary path is removed automatically
2. **Given** multiple cleanup actions already exist on a signal or exit trap, **When** a new cleanup action is added, **Then** existing trap behavior is preserved instead of overwritten

---

### User Story 3 - Bound how long a command may run (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want any command to be ended once it overruns a time
limit so that an automation run cannot hang forever on a wedged network call,
build, or deploy.

**Why this priority**: An unbounded command is the usual cause of a CI job that
has to be cancelled by hand, and of a cron run that overlaps the next one.

**Independent Test**: Run a command that sleeps past its limit and verify it is
ended and reported as a timeout, while a command that finishes in time keeps
its own exit code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command that outlives its limit, **When** it is run under the
   time limit, **Then** it is ended and the caller sees exit code 124
2. **Given** a command that finishes in time, **When** it is run under the time
   limit, **Then** the caller sees the command's own exit code and output
3. **Given** the `timeout` binary is missing or unusable, **When** a command is
   run under a time limit, **Then** the behaviour is unchanged
4. **Given** a shell function rather than a program, **When** it is run under a
   time limit, **Then** it runs and is bounded like any other command

---

### User Story 4 - Run and supervise several background jobs (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want to start long-running commands under a name, wait
for all of them, and learn which one failed, so that a script can run a server
and a worker side by side without losing either job's exit code.

**Why this priority**: `wait` on its own reports only one status, so a script
that starts several jobs cannot say which of them failed.

**Independent Test**: Start one succeeding and one failing job, wait for both,
and verify each job's exit code is reported under its own name.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** several named background jobs, **When** they are all waited for,
   **Then** each job's exit code is available under its name and the wait fails
   when any job failed
2. **Given** a background job that started processes of its own, **When** the
   jobs are ended, **Then** those processes are ended with it rather than
   orphaned
3. **Given** a name whose job is still running, **When** the same name is
   started again, **Then** the request is refused instead of losing the first
   job

---

### User Story 5 - Record and check a PID file (Priority: P2)

As an operator, I want a script to record its process ID and to check whether a
recorded process is still alive, so that a service is not started twice and a
PID file left behind by a crash does not block a restart.

**Why this priority**: A half-written or stale PID file is what makes a
supervisor either start a second copy or refuse to start at all.

**Independent Test**: Write a PID file, verify it reads as running, replace it
with a process ID that has exited, and verify it reads as not running.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PID file recording a live process, **When** it is checked,
   **Then** it reads as running
2. **Given** a PID file that is missing, empty, malformed, or records a process
   that has exited, **When** it is checked, **Then** it reads as not running
3. **Given** a PID file that records another process, **When** removal is
   requested for this process, **Then** the file is left alone

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Install the ERR/INT/TERM handlers once, at the top of the script.
dybatpho::register_common_handlers

dybatpho::create_temp workdir "/" "build"
dybatpho::cleanup_file_on_exit "${workdir}"
dybatpho::trap 'dybatpho::warn "Interrupted, rolling back"; ./rollback.sh' INT TERM

# DRY_RUN=true prints the command instead of running it.
dybatpho::dry_run "rsync -a ${workdir}/ /srv/app/"

[[ -f "${workdir}/manifest" ]] || dybatpho::die "Build produced no manifest" 2

# Nothing may hang the run: 120 seconds, then SIGTERM and SIGKILL.
dybatpho::run_with_timeout 120 ./integration-tests.sh \
  || (($? == 124)) && dybatpho::die "Integration tests did not finish in 120s"

# Two long-running jobs, each reported under its own name.
dybatpho::trap dybatpho::kill_children EXIT INT TERM
dybatpho::background_run api ./serve.sh --port 8080
dybatpho::background_run worker ./worker.sh
dybatpho::wait_all \
  || dybatpho::die "worker exited $(dybatpho::background_status worker)"

# One copy at a time.
dybatpho::pid_file_is_running /var/run/app.pid && dybatpho::die "Already running"
dybatpho::pid_file_write /var/run/app.pid
dybatpho::trap 'dybatpho::pid_file_remove /var/run/app.pid' EXIT
```

## Edge Cases

- A script already has an EXIT or signal trap when dybatpho trap composition is requested.
- `DRY_RUN` is unset, true-like, or false-like.
- A dry-run command is supplied as one shell string (evaluated) or multiple
  arguments (executed directly).
- Cleanup registration runs under normal scripts and Bats test environments.
- An existing trap must be preserved when cleanup or another handler is added.
- The `timeout` binary is absent, or present but rejects `-k`.
- A timed command is a shell function, which no external program can execute.
- A timed command exits with 143 of its own accord, which is indistinguishable
  from being killed by SIGTERM unless the timeout is recorded separately.
- A timed or background command started processes of its own, which must not be
  orphaned when it is ended.
- A timed or background command ignores SIGTERM and has to be sent SIGKILL.
- A time limit of `0` means no limit.
- A background job name is started again after its previous job was reaped, or
  while that job is still running.
- `dybatpho::wait_all` and `dybatpho::kill_children` are called when no job was
  ever started.
- A PID file is missing, unreadable, empty, malformed, padded with whitespace by
  another tool, or records a process that has exited.
- A PID file is removed by a process other than the one it records.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The module MUST provide a fatal exit helper with configurable exit code.
- **FR-002**: The module MUST provide helpers to register ERR and signal handlers, individually and together.
- **FR-003**: The module MUST provide a trap-composition helper that preserves existing trap commands.
- **FR-004**: The module MUST provide deferred cleanup registration for files and directories on shell exit.
- **FR-005**: The module MUST provide a dry-run helper that prints commands instead of executing them when dry-run mode is enabled.
- **FR-006**: Cleanup registration MUST be suitable for temporary resources created during script execution.
- **FR-007**: `DRY_RUN` MUST treat `0`, `true`, `yes`, and `on` as enabled
  values and execute commands otherwise.
- **FR-008**: `dry_run` MUST evaluate a single command string and execute
  multiple arguments directly when dry-run mode is disabled.
- **FR-009**: Signal handlers MUST return 130 for SIGINT and 143 for SIGTERM.
- **FR-010**: Cleanup registration MUST append to existing traps and remove
  registered files or directories on EXIT, HUP, INT, or TERM.
- **FR-011**: The module MUST provide a general time limit for any command,
  reporting exit code 124 when the limit elapses and the command's own exit
  code otherwise.
- **FR-012**: The time limit MUST work without the `timeout` binary, and MUST
  accept a shell function as the command.
- **FR-013**: A timed command MUST be sent SIGTERM first and SIGKILL after
  `DYBATPHO_TIMEOUT_KILL_AFTER` seconds, and the processes it started MUST be
  ended with it.
- **FR-014**: A time limit of `0` MUST run the command without a limit, and a
  limit that is not a non-negative integer MUST stop the script.
- **FR-015**: The module MUST provide named background jobs, recording each
  job's process ID and refusing to start a name whose job is still running.
- **FR-016**: Waiting for the background jobs MUST record each job's exit code
  under its name and MUST fail when any job failed.
- **FR-017**: Ending the background jobs MUST also end the processes those jobs
  started, MUST reap them, and MUST empty the registry so the names can be
  reused.
- **FR-018**: PID file writes MUST be atomic, MUST default to the current
  script's `$$`, and MUST create the directory the file lives in.
- **FR-019**: A PID file check MUST report "not running" for a missing,
  unreadable, empty, or malformed file and for a process that has exited.
- **FR-020**: PID file removal MUST leave a file that records a different
  process alone, and MUST succeed when the file is already gone.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Registered Trap Action**: A command appended to one or more shell trap handlers.
- **Deferred Cleanup Target**: A file or directory scheduled for removal when the owning shell exits.
- **Dry-Run Command**: A command represented as a shell string or argument
  vector and optionally printed instead of run.
- **Timed Command**: A command with a limit in seconds, ended with SIGTERM and
  then SIGKILL once the limit elapses.
- **Background Job**: A named command running in a subshell of the caller, with
  a process ID while it runs and an exit code once it has been reaped.
- **PID File**: A file holding the process ID of the script that owns a
  resource, used to answer whether that process is still running.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Scripts can opt into consistent lifecycle handling with one or two helper calls.
- **SC-002**: Temporary resources do not leak after scripts exit under normal conditions.
- **SC-003**: Operators can preview command execution safely when dry-run mode is enabled.
- **SC-004**: Existing trap behavior is retained when dybatpho handlers and
  cleanup actions are registered.
- **SC-005**: No command run through the module can hang a script for longer
  than its stated limit, on any platform, with or without coreutils.
- **SC-006**: A script that starts several background jobs can name which one
  failed and with what code.
- **SC-007**: An interrupted script leaves behind neither running children nor
  a PID file that belongs to another process.

## Integration Tests *(mandatory)*

- **IT-001**: Register common handlers and verify command failures trigger the shared error path.
- **IT-002**: Register cleanup for a file and directory, exit the shell, and verify both are removed.
- **IT-003**: Set `DRY_RUN=true` and verify the dry-run helper prints the command without executing it.
- **IT-004**: Verify false-like dry-run execution, signal-specific statuses,
  and trap composition with pre-existing handlers.
- **IT-005**: Run a command past its limit and verify exit code 124, both with
  the `timeout` binary and with the probe forced off.
- **IT-006**: Run a shell function under a time limit and verify it is bounded,
  and that a command exiting 143 of its own accord is not reported as a
  timeout.
- **IT-007**: Time out a command that started a grandchild and verify the
  grandchild is gone.
- **IT-008**: Start a succeeding and a failing background job, wait for both,
  and verify each exit code and the aggregate failure.
- **IT-009**: End the background jobs and verify the jobs, their children, and
  the registry are all gone.
- **IT-010**: Write, check, and remove a PID file across the live, stale,
  malformed, missing, padded, and foreign-owner cases.

## Acceptance Criteria *(mandatory)*

1. The module provides the lifecycle guardrails required by file, network, and example scripts.
2. Trap composition and cleanup remain safe to reuse across multiple script layers.
