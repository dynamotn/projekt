# Feature Specification: Time-to-Live Cache on Disk

**Feature Branch**: `[cache-ttl]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/cache.sh`, `doc/cache.md`, `test/cache.bats`, and `example/cache_ops.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

A script that asks a slow question more than once writes the same four lines
every time: work out a file name, read how old that file is, compare the age
against a number of seconds, and remember to create the directory first.
`dybatpho::file_age_seconds` documents exactly that shape as its own usage
example, and `src/ai.sh` had written it out in full, which is how the library
came to carry a cache that nothing else could use.

That private copy also had two defects a shared one does not. It read the
modification time with `date -r FILE`, where BSD `date` expects a number of
seconds rather than a path, so the age was wrong or unreadable outside GNU
coreutils. And it wrote entries with a plain redirection, which truncates the
file before filling it, so a reader running at the same moment could see an
empty or half-written entry.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

Repeated work against a slow or rate-limited source is the common cost in CI
and in operator scripts: the same API listing fetched once per job step, the
same resolution repeated per host. One call turns that into one request,
without the caller hand-rolling expiry logic that is easy to get subtly wrong
and that nothing tests.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Ask a slow question once (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want to run a command and reuse its output until it goes
stale, so that a listing I need in five places is fetched once.

**Independent Test**: Run a command through the cache twice and verify it was
executed once.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no entry exists, **When** the command is run through the cache,
   **Then** the command runs and its output is both printed and stored.
2. **Given** a fresh entry exists, **When** the same call is made, **Then** the
   stored output is printed and the command does not run.
3. **Given** a time to live of zero, **When** the call is made, **Then** the
   command runs again, so a script can offer a refresh without deleting files.

### User Story 2 - Do not remember a failure (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want a failed command to be asked again next time, so
that one bad minute does not become a whole time to live of them.

**Independent Test**: Run a failing command through the cache and verify
nothing was stored and its exit status came back.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command that exits non-zero, **When** it is run through the
   cache, **Then** its exit status is returned and no entry is written.
2. **Given** that same key, **When** the call is repeated, **Then** the command
   runs again.

### User Story 3 - Keep unrelated caches apart (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want two parts of a script to use the same obvious key
without colliding, so that neither has to invent a prefix.

**Independent Test**: Store the same key in two namespaces and verify each
reads back its own value and clears independently.

### User Story 4 - Give a module its own cache directory (Priority: P2)

As a module author, I want to point the cache at a directory my own
configuration names, so that a documented setting such as
`DYBATPHO_AI_CACHE_DIR` keeps working.

**Independent Test**: Set the cache directory with an empty namespace and
verify entries land directly in it.

### Example Workflow

```sh
. dybatpho/init.sh --modules cache

releases="$(dybatpho::cache_run gh-releases 3600 -- gh api /repos/o/r/releases)"

key="$(dybatpho::cache_key "${url}")"
if ! body="$(dybatpho::cache_get "${key}" 600)"; then
  body="$(dybatpho::curl_json "${url}" /dev/stdout)"
  printf '%s\n' "${body}" | dybatpho::cache_set "${key}"
fi
```

## Edge Cases

- A key that could leave the cache directory, such as `../escape` or `a/b`.
- A key that is an arbitrary value: a URL, a request body, a whole command line.
- An entry written moments ago against a time to live of zero.
- A namespace that has never been written being cleared.
- A file in the cache directory that this module did not write.
- `DRY_RUN` set, with no cache directory in existence yet.
- A command that prints to standard error as well as standard output.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The module MUST store entries under a configurable directory, grouped by a configurable namespace, and MUST place entries directly in the directory when the namespace is empty.
- **FR-002**: The module MUST expose the directory and the path of an entry, so a caller can report where its cache lives.
- **FR-003**: A key MUST be usable as a file name. The module MUST refuse a key that is not, rather than sanitising it into something the caller did not ask for, and MUST offer a hashing helper for values that are not already short names.
- **FR-004**: The hashing helper MUST accept several values and MUST NOT hash two values to the same key as their concatenation.
- **FR-005**: An entry MUST be fresh while its age is less than the time to live, so that a time to live of zero makes nothing fresh. The module MUST NOT offer a value meaning "never expires".
- **FR-006**: The module MUST take the time to live per call, falling back to a configured default.
- **FR-007**: Entries MUST be written atomically, so a reader sees either the previous entry or the complete new one.
- **FR-008**: Storing an entry MUST create the directory it needs, and MUST NOT let the output of doing so reach the stored content.
- **FR-009**: The module MUST memoize a command: printing a fresh entry when there is one, otherwise running the command, storing its standard output, and printing it.
- **FR-009a**: A command that exits non-zero MUST NOT be stored, and its exit status MUST be returned unchanged.
- **FR-009b**: The command's standard error MUST NOT be captured, so a warning it prints is seen on every call rather than once.
- **FR-010**: The module MUST remove a single entry, and MUST remove every entry of a namespace while leaving files it did not write alone.
- **FR-011**: Removing an entry or a namespace that is not there MUST succeed.
- **FR-012**: `DRY_RUN` MUST report a write, a removal, and a clear instead of performing them, and MUST work when the cache directory does not yet exist.
- **FR-013**: The `ai` module MUST use this module rather than its own copy, keeping `DYBATPHO_AI_CACHE_DIR`, `DYBATPHO_AI_CACHE_TTL`, and `DYBATPHO_AI_CACHE` working as documented.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Entry**: One stored answer, named by its key and aged by its modification time.
- **Namespace**: A subdirectory grouping entries that belong together.
- **Time to live**: The number of seconds an entry stays usable.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A repeated slow call is made once per time to live rather than once per use.
- **SC-002**: A caller offers a refresh without deleting anything, by asking with a time to live of zero.
- **SC-003**: A transient failure is retried on the next call rather than remembered.
- **SC-004**: A reader never sees a partially written entry.
- **SC-005**: The library carries one cache implementation rather than one per module.

## Integration Tests *(mandatory)*

- **IT-001**: Verify the directory includes the namespace, and that an empty namespace puts entries directly in the cache directory.
- **IT-002**: Verify the entry path for a valid key, and that `../escape`, `a/b`, and an empty key are refused.
- **IT-003**: Verify the hashing helper produces a usable key, is stable, distinguishes two values from their concatenation, and refuses no arguments.
- **IT-004**: Store and read an entry back, with an explicit time to live and with the default, and verify a missing entry reports absent.
- **IT-005**: Verify nothing but the stored content ends up in an entry, including the path the directory helper prints.
- **IT-006**: Backdate an entry and verify it stops being fresh against a short time to live and stays readable against a long one.
- **IT-007**: Verify a time to live of zero makes a just-written entry stale, and that a non-numeric one stops the script.
- **IT-008**: Run a command through the cache twice and verify it executed once; verify the default time to live is a hit and a zero one re-runs.
- **IT-009**: Run a failing command and verify its status comes back, nothing is printed, and no entry is stored.
- **IT-010**: Verify a missing command after the separator, and a call with no separator, stop the script.
- **IT-011**: Verify removing one entry leaves the others, and that removing an absent one succeeds.
- **IT-012**: Verify clearing a namespace removes this module's entries, leaves a foreign file alone, and succeeds on a namespace never written.
- **IT-013**: Store the same key in two namespaces and verify each reads back its own value and that clearing one leaves the other.
- **IT-014**: Verify `DRY_RUN` stores nothing when no directory exists, and leaves an existing entry in place for a removal and a clear.
- **IT-015**: Verify the `ai` module still answers from its cache and still clears it, through its own documented environment variables.

## Acceptance Criteria *(mandatory)*

1. A slow command run through the cache executes once per time to live.
2. A failed command is never stored and its status reaches the caller.
3. Entries expire on their modification time, and a zero time to live forces a refresh.
4. Clearing a namespace touches only entries this module wrote.
5. `src/ai.sh` holds no cache implementation of its own.
