# Feature Specification: Operating System and Architecture Normalization

**Feature Branch**: `[reverse-spec-os]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/os.sh`, `doc/os.md`, `test/os.bats`, and `example/os_ops.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Shell scripts that fetch platform-specific binaries or compose platform-aware paths need normalized OS and architecture identifiers, but raw `uname` output varies across platforms and is not always aligned with common distribution targets such as Go toolchain naming.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Normalize platform detection for cross-platform scripts.
- Reduce repeated `uname` case analysis in consumer scripts.
- Make binary-selection logic more portable and predictable.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Map runtime OS to a normalized target name (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want a helper that translates local operating system information into normalized names so that I can choose the correct platform artifacts.

**Why this priority**: OS normalization is the primary reason this module exists.

**Independent Test**: Stub representative `uname` outputs and verify the OS helper returns the expected normalized result.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the runtime is Linux on a standard distribution, **When** the OS helper runs, **Then** the helper returns `linux`
2. **Given** the runtime is a Windows-compatible environment such as Cygwin, MSYS, or MinGW, **When** the OS helper runs, **Then** the helper returns the normalized Windows target name

### User Story 2 - Map runtime CPU architecture to a normalized target name (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want architecture normalization so that downloads and packaging steps can target the right binary variant.

**Why this priority**: Architecture mismatch directly breaks installation and distribution flows.

**Independent Test**: Stub representative machine architectures and verify the architecture helper returns the expected normalized value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the runtime reports common 64-bit x86 architecture, **When** the architecture helper runs, **Then** the helper returns the normalized amd64 target name
2. **Given** the runtime reports an ARM or 32-bit architecture, **When** the architecture helper runs, **Then** the helper returns the corresponding normalized target name

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Select the right release artifact for the current host.
asset="mytool_$(dybatpho::goos)_$(dybatpho::goarch).tar.gz"
dybatpho::info "Downloading ${asset}"

if dybatpho::is_macos; then
  brew_prefix="$(dybatpho::command_path brew)"
  dybatpho::info "Using Homebrew at ${brew_prefix}"
elif dybatpho::is_linux; then
  dybatpho::info "Using $(dybatpho::command_path apt-get dnf apk)"
fi
```

## Edge Cases

- Linux reports the Android userspace variant.
- The architecture is unknown and must pass through unchanged.
- Different Windows-compatible environments report distinct `uname` strings that should normalize to one target name.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The module MUST normalize runtime operating system names into distribution-oriented target values.
- **FR-002**: The OS helper MUST distinguish Android from generic Linux when the runtime exposes that variant.
- **FR-003**: The module MUST normalize common CPU architectures into target values suitable for cross-platform artifact selection.
- **FR-004**: Unknown architecture strings MUST remain available to callers instead of being silently discarded.
- **FR-005**: The module MUST expose normalized platform predicates for common host systems.
- **FR-006**: The module MUST provide command capability lookup without requiring platform-specific paths.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Normalized GOOS**: The platform name returned by the OS helper for downstream artifact selection.
- **Normalized GOARCH**: The architecture name returned by the architecture helper for downstream artifact selection.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Consumers can reuse one OS helper and one architecture helper instead of maintaining custom mapping tables.
- **SC-002**: Normalized outputs are suitable for common binary-distribution workflows.
- **SC-003**: Unknown values remain inspectable when no known mapping exists.

## Integration Tests *(mandatory)*

- **IT-001**: Stub Linux, Android, and Windows-like `uname` outputs and verify normalized OS values.
- **IT-002**: Stub amd64, 386, arm, and arm64 architectures and verify normalized architecture values.
- **IT-003**: Pass through an unknown architecture string and verify the helper preserves it.
- **IT-004**: Verify `platform`, `is_macos`, and `is_linux` use the normalized OS value.
- **IT-005**: Verify command lookup returns the first available command.

## Acceptance Criteria *(mandatory)*

1. The module provides a small but complete normalization contract for platform-aware scripts.
2. OS and architecture naming remains predictable enough for download and packaging workflows.
