# Feature Specification: File Contents, Preview, and Temporary Resource Management

**Feature Branch**: `[reverse-spec-file]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/file.sh`, `doc/file.md`, `test/file.bats`, and `example/file_ops.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Shell automation often needs quick file inspection, path decomposition, path joining, path normalization, relative path calculation, extension inspection and rewriting, absolute-path checks, and temporary file or directory creation with reliable cleanup. Ad hoc implementations increase the chance of leaked paths, naming collisions, inconsistent file previews, and repeated path-splitting snippets.

Two more gaps sit next to these. Locating the root of the project a script was invoked inside means walking up the directory tree by hand, and creating a directory before writing into it means repeating a `mkdir -p` guard at every call site.

Rewriting the contents of a file is just as common and more dangerous. A script that redirects into a file truncates it before the new contents are written, so an interrupted run destroys the original; `sed -i` takes a different argument on GNU and BSD; appending a line to a dotfile duplicates it on the second run; and reading a size, checksum, or modification time means picking between incompatible `stat` and checksum tools per platform.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Make temporary resource handling safer and more reusable.
- Support quick inspection of files during debugging and operator workflows.
- Build on process-level cleanup guarantees without forcing callers to wire them manually.
- Keep common dirname and basename logic inside the existing file module.
- Support filename extension and stem handling without extra external commands or inline parameter expansion.
- Support safe path assembly without repeated slash-cleanup snippets in calling scripts.
- Support textual path cleanup for repeated separators and dot-segments without requiring filesystem access.
- Support lightweight path inspection and extension rewriting without external commands.
- Make rewriting a file safe by default, so that an interrupted script cannot leave a truncated file behind.
- Let a script that maintains a dotfile run repeatedly without duplicating what it added.
- Read file metadata identically on GNU, BusyBox, and BSD systems.
- Edit a dotfile that is symlinked into a repository without detaching the link from it.
- Locate a project root from any directory inside it.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Preview files during script execution (Priority: P2)

As an operator, I want to inspect files with line numbers so that debugging generated or downloaded content is easier.

**Why this priority**: Preview is secondary to temp management but still useful in real workflows.

**Independent Test**: Call the file-preview helper for a real file and verify line-numbered output appears on stderr.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the `bat` command is available, **When** the file-preview helper runs, **Then** the file is shown using the richer preview path
2. **Given** the `bat` command is unavailable, **When** the file-preview helper runs, **Then** the file is still shown with numbered fallback output

---

### User Story 2 - Create temporary resources safely (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want a helper that creates temp files or directories and registers cleanup automatically so that I can use ephemeral workspaces without cleanup boilerplate.

**Why this priority**: Temporary resource safety is the module’s primary value and underpins many shell workflows.

**Independent Test**: Create temp files and directories under default and custom parents, then verify the returned paths exist and are cleaned up on shell exit.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the caller requests a temporary file, **When** the temp helper runs, **Then** a unique path is created and stored in the requested variable
2. **Given** the caller requests a temporary directory, **When** the temp helper runs with directory mode, **Then** a unique directory is created and registered for cleanup

---

### User Story 3 - Split paths inside scripts (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want dirname and basename helpers so that file-path logic stays readable and consistent with the rest of the library.

**Why this priority**: Path decomposition often appears next to temp-file and download workflows and fits naturally in the file module.

**Independent Test**: Run the path helpers against absolute, relative, root, and suffixed paths and verify the printed components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an absolute file path, **When** the dirname helper runs, **Then** it prints the directory component
2. **Given** a path and an optional suffix, **When** the basename helper runs, **Then** it prints the basename and strips the suffix when it matches

---

### User Story 4 - Inspect extensions and stems (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want helpers for final extensions and stems so that file-type and naming logic can stay inside the same file module.

**Why this priority**: Extension and stem handling are direct follow-ups to basename logic and are common in scripting workflows.

**Independent Test**: Run the extension and stem helpers against normal files, multi-dot names, and hidden files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a path with a final extension, **When** the extname helper runs, **Then** it prints the final extension with the leading dot
2. **Given** a path with multiple dots, **When** the stem helper runs, **Then** it removes only the final extension and keeps the rest of the basename

---

### User Story 5 - Join path segments predictably (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want a helper that joins path fragments with single separators so that I can build paths from variables without hand-written slash cleanup.

**Why this priority**: Path composition is a direct companion to dirname, basename, extname, and stem helpers.

**Independent Test**: Join absolute and relative path fragments with empty segments and repeated slashes, then verify the resulting path uses single separators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple path fragments with mixed leading and trailing slashes, **When** the join helper runs, **Then** the result contains single `/` separators between fragments
2. **Given** empty fragments around an absolute root, **When** the join helper runs, **Then** empty segments are ignored and the root is preserved

---

### User Story 6 - Normalize paths textually (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want a helper that cleans repeated separators plus `.` and `..` path segments so that path strings can be stabilized without touching the filesystem.

**Why this priority**: Path normalization naturally complements join, dirname, basename, extname, and stem helpers.

**Independent Test**: Normalize absolute and relative paths with repeated separators and dot-segments, then verify relative `..` segments are preserved when they cannot be reduced further.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a path with repeated separators plus `.` and `..` segments, **When** the normalize helper runs, **Then** the result is a cleaned textual path
2. **Given** a relative path that begins with unresolved `..` segments, **When** the normalize helper runs, **Then** those parent traversals are preserved

---

### User Story 7 - Rewrite a file without risking its contents (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want to replace what a file contains in one step so that a reader never sees a half-written file and an interrupted run leaves the original intact.

**Why this priority**: A truncated configuration file breaks the system the script was meant to configure, and the failure surfaces long after the script exits.

**Independent Test**: Write new contents over an existing file, then verify the contents, that the file's mode survived, and that no staging file is left behind.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing file with mode 640, **When** the atomic-write helper replaces its contents, **Then** the new contents are in place and the mode is still 640
2. **Given** a rewrite helper fails part way, **When** the failure is reported, **Then** the original file still holds its previous contents and no staging file remains
3. **Given** a pattern to substitute, **When** the replace helper runs on GNU or BSD, **Then** the substitution is applied the same way without an `-i` argument

---

### User Story 8 - Keep a line in a dotfile exactly once (Priority: P1)

As a dotfiles author, I want to guarantee a line is present or absent so that running my bootstrap script twice leaves the same result as running it once.

**Why this priority**: Bootstrap scripts are re-run by design; a helper that appends unconditionally corrupts the file it maintains.

**Independent Test**: Call the ensure-line helper twice with the same line and verify the line appears exactly once, then call the remove-line helper twice and verify it is gone and no error is raised.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file that already contains the exact line, **When** the ensure-line helper runs again, **Then** the file is unchanged
2. **Given** a file whose last line has no trailing newline, **When** the ensure-line helper appends, **Then** the new line is a separate line
3. **Given** a file that does not contain the line, **When** the remove-line helper runs, **Then** it reports success and changes nothing

---

### User Story 9 - Read file metadata portably (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want size, checksum, and age of a file from one helper each so that my script behaves the same on GNU, BusyBox, and BSD.

**Why this priority**: These reads are simple individually, but each one needs a different tool per platform, which is exactly the duplication the library exists to remove.

**Independent Test**: Read the size, checksum, and age of a known file and compare against independently computed values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file of known contents, **When** the hash helper runs, **Then** the checksum matches the reference value for the requested algorithm
2. **Given** a file modified in the past, **When** the age helper runs, **Then** it reports the elapsed seconds since its modification time
3. **Given** a file about to be edited, **When** the backup helper runs, **Then** it copies the file under a new name and prints that path

---

### User Story 10 - Edit a dotfile that is a symlink (Priority: P1)

As a dotfiles author, I want to edit a path that is a symlink into my repository and have the repository file change, so that my edit is tracked rather than silently detached.

**Why this priority**: Replacing the symlink looks like success. The damage only surfaces later, when the repository turns out not to contain the change and the next deployment reverts it.

**Independent Test**: Point a symlink at a file in another directory, rewrite the symlink's path, then verify the path is still a symlink and the file it points at holds the new contents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a path that is a symlink, **When** any writing helper runs on it, **Then** the link is preserved and the file it points at is the one rewritten
2. **Given** a chain of symlinks or a relative symlink, **When** a writing helper runs, **Then** the file at the end of the chain is rewritten
3. **Given** a symlink loop, **When** a writing helper runs, **Then** the helper reports the loop instead of following it forever
4. **Given** a caller that wants the old behavior, **When** symlink following is disabled, **Then** the helper replaces the symlink with a regular file

---

### User Story 11 - Find the project root from anywhere inside it (Priority: P1)

As a tool author, I want to search upward for a marker such as `.git` so that my script behaves the same whichever subdirectory it was invoked from.

**Why this priority**: Nearly every repository-aware script needs this, and each one otherwise reimplements the same upward walk.

**Independent Test**: Search for a marker from a nested directory and verify the marker's path is printed, then search for a name that does not exist and verify failure without output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a marker in an ancestor directory, **When** the search helper runs from a nested directory, **Then** it prints the absolute path of the marker
2. **Given** a marker that is a directory rather than a file, **When** the search helper runs, **Then** it is found just the same
3. **Given** no matching entry up to the filesystem root, **When** the search helper runs, **Then** it reports failure and prints nothing

---

### User Story 12 - Create a directory before writing into it (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want one helper that creates a directory tree and reports its path so that I do not repeat a `mkdir -p` guard before every write.

**Why this priority**: Small individually, but it appears before nearly every write, and pairs with the atomic writers, which require the destination directory to exist.

**Independent Test**: Create a nested directory with a mode, call the helper again, and verify the directory, its mode, and the printed path are unchanged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a nested path that does not exist, **When** the helper runs, **Then** every missing parent is created and the path is printed
2. **Given** a directory that already exists, **When** the helper runs again with a mode, **Then** the mode is applied and nothing else changes
3. **Given** a path that exists as a file, **When** the helper runs, **Then** it reports the conflict instead of failing obscurely later

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Build a report in a temporary file that is cleaned up on exit.
dybatpho::create_temp report_file ".csv" "build-report"
dybatpho::cleanup_file_on_exit "${report_file}"

# Derive sibling paths without shelling out to dirname/basename.
config="$(dybatpho::path_join "$(dybatpho::path_dirname "${report_file}")" "report.json")"
dybatpho::info "stem=$(dybatpho::path_stem "${report_file}")"
dybatpho::info "json=$(dybatpho::path_change_ext "${report_file}" json)"

dybatpho::path_is_abs "${config}" || dybatpho::die "Expected an absolute path"
dybatpho::show_file "${report_file}"
```

## Edge Cases

- The target variable name is empty or invalid.
- The caller requests a custom parent directory that does not exist.
- The extension includes unsafe slash content that must not survive into the created file suffix.
- The input path is the filesystem root, a relative path without separators, or a path with trailing slashes.
- The input path is a hidden file or a basename without an extension.
- Path joining receives empty fragments or repeated slashes between fragments.
- Path normalization receives empty input, absolute root traversals, or unresolved relative parent traversals.
- Relative-path calculation may compare absolute paths, relative paths, or mixed path styles.

- **FR-014**: The temp helper MUST support default and custom parent directories.
- **FR-015**: The temp helper MUST register created resources for cleanup on shell exit.

- **FR-031**: Every helper that changes a file MUST honor `DRY_RUN` by reporting the intended change and leaving the filesystem untouched.
- **FR-032**: Every helper that changes a file MUST resolve a symlink destination to the file it points at, so that the link is preserved rather than replaced, and MUST follow chains and relative links.

- **FR-034**: Metadata helpers MUST report the file a symlink points at rather than the link itself.
- **FR-035**: The module MUST provide a helper that searches a directory and its ancestors for a named entry, matching files and directories alike, printing the absolute path of the first match and reporting failure without output when the filesystem root is reached.
- **FR-036**: The module MUST provide a helper that creates a directory and its missing parents, applies an optional mode whether or not the directory already existed, prints the resulting path, and rejects a path that exists as something other than a directory.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Temporary Resource**: A file or directory created for short-lived script use and scheduled for cleanup.
- **Preview Target**: A user-specified file path whose content is displayed for inspection.
- **Input Path**: A path string whose directory or basename component is requested by the caller.
- **Final Extension**: The last dot-prefixed suffix of a basename when one exists.

2. Temporary resource creation integrates cleanly with the process cleanup contract.
3. Path decomposition, joining, normalization, extension lookup, and stem extraction are available directly inside the file module without separate external command calls.
