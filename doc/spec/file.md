# Feature Specification: File Preview and Temporary Resource Management

**Feature Branch**: `[reverse-spec-file]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/file.sh`, `doc/file.md`, `test/file.bats`, and `example/file_ops.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Shell automation often needs quick file inspection, path decomposition, path joining, path normalization, relative path calculation, extension inspection and rewriting, absolute-path checks, and temporary file or directory creation with reliable cleanup. Ad hoc implementations increase the chance of leaked paths, naming collisions, inconsistent file previews, and repeated path-splitting snippets.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Make temporary resource handling safer and more reusable.
- Support quick inspection of files during debugging and operator workflows.
- Build on process-level cleanup guarantees without forcing callers to wire them manually.
- Keep common dirname and basename logic inside the existing file module.
- Support filename extension and stem handling without extra external commands or inline parameter expansion.
- Support safe path assembly without repeated slash-cleanup snippets in calling scripts.
- Support textual path cleanup for repeated separators and dot-segments without requiring filesystem access.
- Support lightweight path inspection and extension rewriting without external commands.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Preview files during script execution (Priority: P2)

As an operator, I want to inspect files with line numbers so that debugging generated or downloaded content is easier.

**Why this priority**: Preview is secondary to temp management but still useful in real workflows.

**Independent Test**: Call the file-preview helper for a real file and verify line-numbered output appears on stderr.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the `bat` command is available, **When** the file-preview helper runs, **Then** the file is shown using the richer preview path
2. **Given** the `bat` command is unavailable, **When** the file-preview helper runs, **Then** the file is still shown with numbered fallback output

---

### User Story 2 - Create temporary resources safely (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want a helper that creates temp files or directories and registers cleanup automatically so that I can use ephemeral workspaces without cleanup boilerplate.

**Why this priority**: Temporary resource safety is the module’s primary value and underpins many shell workflows.

**Independent Test**: Create temp files and directories under default and custom parents, then verify the returned paths exist and are cleaned up on shell exit.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the caller requests a temporary file, **When** the temp helper runs, **Then** a unique path is created and stored in the requested variable
2. **Given** the caller requests a temporary directory, **When** the temp helper runs with directory mode, **Then** a unique directory is created and registered for cleanup

---

### User Story 3 - Split paths inside scripts (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want dirname and basename helpers so that file-path logic stays readable and consistent with the rest of the library.

**Why this priority**: Path decomposition often appears next to temp-file and download workflows and fits naturally in the file module.

**Independent Test**: Run the path helpers against absolute, relative, root, and suffixed paths and verify the printed components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an absolute file path, **When** the dirname helper runs, **Then** it prints the directory component
2. **Given** a path and an optional suffix, **When** the basename helper runs, **Then** it prints the basename and strips the suffix when it matches

---

### User Story 4 - Inspect extensions and stems (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want helpers for final extensions and stems so that file-type and naming logic can stay inside the same file module.

**Why this priority**: Extension and stem handling are direct follow-ups to basename logic and are common in scripting workflows.

**Independent Test**: Run the extension and stem helpers against normal files, multi-dot names, and hidden files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a path with a final extension, **When** the extname helper runs, **Then** it prints the final extension with the leading dot
2. **Given** a path with multiple dots, **When** the stem helper runs, **Then** it removes only the final extension and keeps the rest of the basename

---

### User Story 5 - Join path segments predictably (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want a helper that joins path fragments with single separators so that I can build paths from variables without hand-written slash cleanup.

**Why this priority**: Path composition is a direct companion to dirname, basename, extname, and stem helpers.

**Independent Test**: Join absolute and relative path fragments with empty segments and repeated slashes, then verify the resulting path uses single separators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple path fragments with mixed leading and trailing slashes, **When** the join helper runs, **Then** the result contains single `/` separators between fragments
2. **Given** empty fragments around an absolute root, **When** the join helper runs, **Then** empty segments are ignored and the root is preserved

---

### User Story 6 - Normalize paths textually (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want a helper that cleans repeated separators plus `.` and `..` path segments so that path strings can be stabilized without touching the filesystem.

**Why this priority**: Path normalization naturally complements join, dirname, basename, extname, and stem helpers.

**Independent Test**: Normalize absolute and relative paths with repeated separators and dot-segments, then verify relative `..` segments are preserved when they cannot be reduced further.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a path with repeated separators plus `.` and `..` segments, **When** the normalize helper runs, **Then** the result is a cleaned textual path
2. **Given** a relative path that begins with unresolved `..` segments, **When** the normalize helper runs, **Then** those parent traversals are preserved

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Build a report in a temporary file that is cleaned up on exit.
dybatpho::create_temp report_file ".csv" "build-report"
dybatpho::cleanup_file_on_exit "${report_file}"

# Derive sibling paths without shelling out to dirname/basename.
config="$(dybatpho::path_join "$(dybatpho::path_dirname "${report_file}")" "report.json")"
dybatpho::info "stem=$(dybatpho::path_stem "${report_file}")"
dybatpho::info "json=$(dybatpho::path_change_ext "${report_file}" json)"

dybatpho::path_is_abs "${config}" || dybatpho::die "Expected an absolute path"
dybatpho::show_file "${report_file}"
```

## Edge Cases

- The target variable name is empty or invalid.
- The caller requests a custom parent directory that does not exist.
- The extension includes unsafe slash content that must not survive into the created file suffix.
- The input path is the filesystem root, a relative path without separators, or a path with trailing slashes.
- The input path is a hidden file or a basename without an extension.
- Path joining receives empty fragments or repeated slashes between fragments.
- Path normalization receives empty input, absolute root traversals, or unresolved relative parent traversals.
- Relative-path calculation may compare absolute paths, relative paths, or mixed path styles.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-014**: The temp helper MUST support default and custom parent directories.
- **FR-015**: The temp helper MUST register created resources for cleanup on shell exit.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Temporary Resource**: A file or directory created for short-lived script use and scheduled for cleanup.
- **Preview Target**: A user-specified file path whose content is displayed for inspection.
- **Input Path**: A path string whose directory or basename component is requested by the caller.
