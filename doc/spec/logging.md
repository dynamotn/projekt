# Feature Specification: Structured Logging and Trace Output

**Feature Branch**: `[reverse-spec-logging]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/logging.sh`, `doc/logging.md`, `test/logging.bats`, and `example/logging_demo.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Shell automation needs consistent human-readable logging with level filtering, diagnostics, banners, and optional trace output. Ad hoc `echo` usage makes scripts noisy, inconsistent, and hard to debug.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Standardize log output across scripts and examples.
- Allow scripts to tune verbosity without rewriting call sites.
- Provide rich diagnostic and trace helpers for debugging shell behavior.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Emit logs at controlled verbosity (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want level-aware logging so that users can see concise output by default and richer diagnostics when needed.

**Why this priority**: Log filtering determines day-to-day usability for every script built on the library.

**Independent Test**: Set different `LOG_LEVEL` values and verify only messages at or above the configured threshold are emitted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the runtime log level is `info`, **When** debug and info helpers are called, **Then** info logs are shown and debug logs are suppressed
2. **Given** the runtime log level is `trace`, **When** trace-capable flows run, **Then** trace, debug, and normal messages become visible

---

### User Story 2 - Render status banners and diagnostics (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want progress, success, warning, and error messages rendered consistently so that long-running scripts are easier to follow.

**Why this priority**: Structured presentation is a core usability benefit of the module.

**Independent Test**: Call the banner-style helpers and verify the expected channel, formatting, and level behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a script starts a major step, **When** the progress helper runs, **Then** a highlighted progress banner is printed
2. **Given** a script hits a failure path, **When** the fatal or error helper runs, **Then** a diagnostic message is rendered to stderr with context
3. **Given** a task reports a percentage, **When** the progress-bar helper runs,
   **Then** it renders an in-place bar with the requested width

---

### User Story 3 - Emit machine-readable diagnostics (Priority: P2)

As a CI operator, I want structured JSON logging so that automated systems can
parse timestamps, levels, source locations, and messages without ANSI cleanup.

**Independent Test**: Set `LOG_FORMAT=json`, emit a diagnostic containing
quotes and newlines, and parse the resulting JSON record.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `LOG_FORMAT=json`, **When** a diagnostic helper emits a message,
   **Then** stderr contains one JSON object with timestamp, level, source, and
   escaped message fields
2. **Given** the default text format, **When** a diagnostic helper emits a
   message, **Then** the output remains human-readable and includes source
   context

---

### User Story 4 - Correlate and time structured events (Priority: P2)

As a CI/CD engineer, I want every structured log event enriched with a
correlation ID, hostname, process ID, and elapsed duration so that I can
trace a single run across parallel workers and log aggregation systems
without adding custom instrumentation.

**Why this priority**: Distributed pipelines run many script instances
concurrently; without a correlation ID and process context, log lines from
different runs are indistinguishable once aggregated.

**Independent Test**: Emit two diagnostics from the same process with
`LOG_REQUEST_ID` unset and verify both events carry the same generated
`request_id`, plus non-empty `hostname`, `pid`, and `duration_ms` fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `LOG_REQUEST_ID` is unset, **When** the first structured event is
   emitted, **Then** a correlation ID is generated once and reused for every
   later event in the same process
2. **Given** `LOG_REQUEST_ID` is exported by the caller (for example a CI
   pipeline), **When** structured events are emitted, **Then** that ID is used
   verbatim instead of generating a new one
3. **Given** any structured event is emitted, **Then** it includes the current
   hostname, process ID, and milliseconds elapsed since the process started

---

### User Story 5 - Persist logs to a rotating file at independent verbosity (Priority: P2)

As an operator running long-lived or scheduled scripts, I want log output
written to a file with size-based rotation, independent of what is shown on
stdout/stderr, so that I can keep a durable audit trail without unbounded
disk growth or duplicating console noise.

**Why this priority**: Interactive verbosity and archival verbosity are
different concerns; forcing them to share one threshold either floods the
terminal or under-populates the audit log.

**Independent Test**: Set `LOG_FILE` to a path and `LOG_FILE_LEVEL` to a level
more verbose than `LOG_LEVEL`, emit events at multiple levels, and verify the
file captures more events than stdout while every file line is valid JSON.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** `LOG_FILE` points to a path whose parent directory does not
   exist, **When** a log event is emitted, **Then** the directory is created
   and the event is appended as a JSON line
2. **Given** `LOG_FILE_LEVEL` is more permissive than `LOG_LEVEL`, **When**
   events at an intermediate severity are emitted, **Then** they appear in the
   file but not on stdout
3. **Given** the log file reaches `LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES`, **When** another event
   is appended, **Then** the file is rotated into a numbered backup before the
   new event is written, and backups beyond `LOG_FILE_MAX_BACKUPS` are pruned
4. **Given** `LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES=0`, **When** the file grows past what would
   normally trigger rotation, **Then** rotation is disabled and the file keeps
   growing
5. **Given** `LOG_FILE` is unset, **When** any log event is emitted, **Then**
   no file is created and no error is raised

---

### User Story 6 - Turn on the file sink in one call (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want to name the log file, its rotation threshold and
its verbosity in a single call so that enabling a durable log does not mean
exporting four environment variables correctly and hoping the path is
writable.

**Why this priority**: The sink already exists; what makes it usable is a
front door that validates its settings and fails where they are set rather
than silently dropping every later event.

**Independent Test**: Call the helper with a nested path and a `rotate:10M`
setting, then verify the file exists, its mode is `600`, and the rotation
threshold is the byte count that size stands for.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a path whose parent directory does not exist, **When** the helper
   is called, **Then** the directory and the file are created up front and the
   `LOG_FILE*` variables are set accordingly
2. **Given** a rotation size written as `10M`, **When** the helper is called,
   **Then** the threshold is stored as the equivalent number of bytes
3. **Given** a setting that cannot be honored -- an unparseable size, a
   non-numeric backup count, an unknown level, an unknown setting name --
   **When** the helper is called, **Then** it fails with a message naming the
   setting instead of configuring a sink that silently drops events
4. **Given** file logging is on, **When** the helper is called with `off`,
   **Then** later events go to stderr only
5. **Given** the helper creates the log file, **Then** the file is created
   with mode `600`, and a file that already exists keeps the mode it has

---

### User Story 7 - Carry run-wide fields on every event (Priority: P2)

As an operator aggregating logs, I want a run identifier and a stage name
attached to every structured event so that I can filter one run or one phase
without every call site repeating the same values in its message.

**Why this priority**: A correlation ID answers "which run"; the caller's own
fields answer "which customer, which stage, which attempt", which is what
turns an aggregated log into something queryable.

**Independent Test**: Register two fields, emit a JSON event, and verify both
appear as fields of their own after the built-in ones.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** fields are registered, **When** a structured event is emitted,
   **Then** each field appears as a JSON field of its own, after the built-in
   fields, in the order the fields were registered
2. **Given** fields are registered, **When** a text diagnostic is emitted,
   **Then** the same fields follow the message as `name=value` pairs
3. **Given** a field is registered again with a new value, **When** an event
   is emitted, **Then** the new value is used and the field keeps its original
   position
4. **Given** a field name that a log event already uses, or a name that is not
   a valid identifier, **When** it is registered, **Then** the call fails
   rather than producing a duplicated or malformed event
5. **Given** a field value holds a registered secret, or a quote or newline,
   **When** an event is emitted, **Then** the value is redacted and escaped
   exactly as a message is

---

### User Story 8 - Time a step and log how long it took (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want to bracket a step with a timer so that the log says
how long it took, in a field a log aggregator can chart, without hand-rolling
epoch arithmetic at every call site.

**Why this priority**: "Where did the twenty minutes go" is the first question
asked of a slow pipeline, and answering it should not require adding the
metrics module and a Prometheus endpoint.

**Independent Test**: Start a timer, wait, end it, and verify the message
names the timer and its elapsed milliseconds, and that the structured event
carries both as fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a timer was started, **When** it is ended, **Then** a message
   naming the timer and its elapsed milliseconds is logged at `info` by
   default, and the structured event carries `timer` and `elapsed_ms` fields
2. **Given** a timer is ended with an explicit level, **When** that level is
   filtered out by `LOG_LEVEL`, **Then** nothing is shown
3. **Given** a timer was never started, **When** it is ended, **Then** the
   call fails rather than reporting a meaningless duration
4. **Given** a timer has been ended, **Then** its elapsed milliseconds remain
   readable in `DYBATPHO_TIMER_LAST_MS`

---

### User Story 9 - Show that a long command is still running (Priority: P3)

As a user waiting on a script, I want a spinner beside a message while a slow
command runs so that I can tell the difference between working and hung,
without losing the command's output or its exit code.

**Why this priority**: Presentation, not correctness -- but a script that
looks hung gets killed.

**Independent Test**: Run a failing command behind the spinner and verify the
exit code is passed through unchanged and the command's output is untouched.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command is run behind the spinner, **When** it finishes,
   **Then** its exit code is returned unchanged and its output is not captured
   or reordered
2. **Given** stderr is not a terminal, **When** the spinner runs, **Then** the
   message is logged once at `info` and nothing is animated
3. **Given** the spinner animated, **When** the command finishes, **Then** the
   animation is torn down and its line erased, whether the command succeeded
   or failed
4. **Given** any spinner run, **When** it finishes, **Then** a `debug` event
   records the elapsed milliseconds and the exit code
5. **Given** the message holds a registered secret, **When** the spinner draws
   it, **Then** the secret is redacted first

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Text on the terminal, JSON in a rotating file, at independent verbosity.
export LOG_LEVEL="info"
export LOG_FORMAT="text"
export LOG_FILE="/var/log/deploy.log"
export LOG_FILE_LEVEL="debug"
export LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES=$((1024 * 1024))
export LOG_FILE_MAX_BACKUPS=5
export LOG_REQUEST_ID="deploy-42"

dybatpho::header "DEPLOY"
dybatpho::info "Starting deployment"
dybatpho::debug "Only the log file records this line"
dybatpho::progress_bar 50
dybatpho::success "Deployment finished"
```

```bash
# The same run, configured through the helpers instead of the variables.
dybatpho::log_to_file /var/log/deploy.log rotate:10M keep:5 level:debug
dybatpho::log_context add run_id=deploy-42 stage=build

dybatpho::timer_start build
dybatpho::spinner "Building the image" -- docker build -t app .
dybatpho::timer_end build

dybatpho::log_context add stage=publish
dybatpho::spinner "Pushing the image" -- docker push app
dybatpho::log_context clear
```

## Edge Cases

- `NO_COLOR` is set and ANSI color must be suppressed.
- `LOG_LEVEL` is invalid.
- `LOG_FORMAT` is set to a value other than `json` (the implementation uses
  text output).
- A message contains quotes, backslashes, or control characters in JSON mode.
- `COLUMNS` or terminal detection is unavailable while rendering a box.
- A progress percentage is zero, 100, or outside the usual range.
- Trace helpers run in environments that use traps or child shells.
- `hostname` and `uuidgen` binaries are unavailable on the host; hostname and
  correlation ID generation must fall back gracefully.
- `LOG_FILE`'s parent directory does not exist or is not writable.
- `LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES` is `0` (rotation disabled) or `LOG_FILE_MAX_BACKUPS` is
  `0` or negative (truncate-only, no numbered backups retained).
- `LOG_FILE_LEVEL` is unset (defaults to `LOG_LEVEL`) or set independently
  more/less verbose than the stdout level.
- Concurrent processes append to the same `LOG_FILE` simultaneously.
- A rotation size is given in a form the parser does not accept (`1.5M`,
  `ten megabytes`, a negative number), or as `0` to disable rotation.
- The configured log path exists but is not writable, or its parent directory
  cannot be created.
- A context field name collides with a field every event already carries, is
  not a valid identifier, or is registered without a value.
- A context field value holds a quote, a newline, or a registered secret.
- A timer is ended without being started, ended twice, or ended at a level
  that is filtered out or is not a level at all.
- The spinner runs without a terminal on stderr, is disabled with
  `DYBATPHO_SPINNER=never`, or is forced with `always`.
- `sleep` on the host understands whole seconds only, so the spinner interval
  cannot be honored exactly.
- The command run behind the spinner fails, reads stdin, or writes to the same
  terminal the spinner draws on.

  wide Unicode glyphs when `python3` is available.
- **FR-010**: The module MUST provide a percentage progress-bar helper with a
  configurable width.
- **FR-011**: Text and JSON log output MUST redact values registered with
  `src/secret.sh` whenever the masking registry is non-empty, without depending
  on that module being loaded.
- **FR-012**: Every structured (JSON) log event MUST include a correlation ID
  (`request_id`), generating and caching one for the process lifetime when
  `LOG_REQUEST_ID` is empty, and reusing a caller-supplied `LOG_REQUEST_ID`
  verbatim otherwise.
- **FR-013**: Every structured log event MUST include the current `hostname`,
  falling back through `hostname`, `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname`, `$HOSTNAME`,
  and finally the literal `unknown` when no source is available.
- **FR-014**: Every structured log event MUST include the emitting process's
  PID and the number of milliseconds elapsed since the process started
  (`duration_ms`).
- **FR-015**: The module MUST support writing structured JSON log events to a
  file when `LOG_FILE` is set, independent of the stdout `LOG_FORMAT`.
- **FR-016**: File logging MUST support an independent verbosity threshold via
  `LOG_FILE_LEVEL`, defaulting to `LOG_LEVEL` when unset.
- **FR-017**: File logging MUST create missing parent directories before
  writing.
- **FR-018**: The module MUST rotate `LOG_FILE` once it reaches
  `LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES`, keeping up to `LOG_FILE_MAX_BACKUPS` numbered backups
  and pruning older ones; `LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES=0` MUST disable rotation.
- **FR-019**: File log lines MUST be redacted using the same masking registry
  as stdout/stderr output.
- **FR-020**: The module MUST provide `dybatpho::log_to_file`, configuring the
  file sink from one path plus optional `rotate:SIZE`, `keep:COUNT` and
  `level:LEVEL` settings, and `off` MUST turn the sink back off.
- **FR-021**: `dybatpho::log_to_file` MUST accept a rotation size as a byte
  count or with a `K`, `M`, `G` or `T` suffix (optionally `B`/`iB`),
  interpreted as 1024-based, and MUST fail on a size, backup count, level or
  setting name it cannot honor.
- **FR-022**: `dybatpho::log_to_file` MUST create the parent directory and the
  log file before returning, MUST create a new log file with mode `600`, MUST
  leave the mode of an existing file untouched, and MUST fail when the file
  cannot be written.
- **FR-023**: The module MUST provide `dybatpho::log_context` with `add`,
  `remove`, `clear`, `list` and `get` actions, maintaining fields that are
  attached to every later log event.
- **FR-024**: Context fields MUST appear in every structured event as fields of
  their own, after the built-in fields, in registration order, and MUST follow
  the message as `name=value` pairs in text output.
- **FR-025**: `dybatpho::log_context` MUST reject a field name that a log event
  already uses (`timestamp`, `level`, `source`, `message`, `request_id`,
  `hostname`, `pid`, `duration_ms`) and a name that is not a valid identifier.
- **FR-026**: Context field values MUST be JSON-escaped and redacted through
  the masking registry exactly as messages are.
- **FR-027**: The module MUST provide `dybatpho::timer_start` and
  `dybatpho::timer_end`, logging the elapsed milliseconds of a named timer at
  `info` or at a level given by the caller, and MUST fail when the timer was
  never started.
- **FR-028**: A timer's structured event MUST carry `timer` and `elapsed_ms`
  fields, and the elapsed milliseconds MUST also be published in
  `DYBATPHO_TIMER_LAST_MS`.
- **FR-029**: The module MUST provide `dybatpho::spinner MESSAGE -- COMMAND`,
  running the command in the calling shell's foreground and returning its exit
  code unchanged, and MUST fail when the `--` separator or the command is
  missing.
- **FR-030**: The spinner MUST animate only when stderr is a terminal and the
  `info` level passes filtering, MUST log the message once at `info` instead
  when it cannot animate, and MUST honor `DYBATPHO_SPINNER` set to `never` or
  `always`.
- **FR-031**: The spinner MUST erase its line and stop its animation before
  returning, and MUST record the elapsed milliseconds and the command's exit
  code as a `debug` event.
- **FR-032**: The spinner MUST redact registered secrets in its message before
  drawing it.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Log Event**: A user-visible message emitted with a severity level and optional formatting.
- **Runtime Log Level**: The active threshold that determines which log events are shown.
- **Log Format**: `text` human-readable output or `json` structured diagnostic
  output.
- **Progress Bar**: A carriage-return-updated percentage indicator.
- **Masking Registry**: The optional process-local secret registry consulted
  before a log line is written.
- **Correlation ID**: A per-process identifier (`request_id`) attached to
  every structured event so related log lines can be grouped across
  aggregation systems.
- **Log File**: The optional durable destination (`LOG_FILE`) that receives
  JSON events independent of stdout, subject to its own verbosity threshold
  and rotation policy.
- **Rotation Policy**: The size threshold (`LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES`) and backup
  count (`LOG_FILE_MAX_BACKUPS`) governing when and how the log file is
  rotated.
- **Context Field**: A `name=value` pair registered once and attached to every
  later log event, held in the current shell.
- **Timer**: A named start time, turned into an elapsed duration and a log
  event when the step it brackets finishes.
- **Spinner**: A background animation shown beside a message while a
  foreground command runs.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Scripts can change verbosity by setting one environment variable.
- **SC-002**: Consumers can distinguish routine output from warnings and failures at a glance.
- **SC-003**: Trace-enabled sessions expose enough context to debug generated or dynamic shell behavior.
- **SC-004**: JSON-mode diagnostics can be consumed by standard JSON parsers
  without stripping terminal formatting.
- **SC-005**: Boxed progress and status output remains readable for long lines,
  narrow terminals, and wide Unicode text.
- **SC-006**: Log events from a single process can be correlated across
  aggregation systems using a stable `request_id`, `hostname`, and `pid`
  without any extra caller bookkeeping.
- **SC-007**: Long-running or scheduled scripts can persist an audit trail via
  `LOG_FILE` without unbounded disk growth, thanks to automatic rotation.
- **SC-008**: File and stdout verbosity can be tuned independently so
  operators get concise console output while retaining a fuller file record.
- **SC-009**: A durable, rotating, secret-masked log is turned on with one
  call, and a path or setting that would not work is reported where it is
  configured rather than by an empty log file afterwards.
- **SC-010**: Log events from one run can be filtered by the caller's own
  fields, such as a run identifier or a stage, without those values being
  repeated in every message.
- **SC-011**: A script can report how long each step took, and show that a
  slow step is still alive, without hand-rolled timing or output handling and
  without changing the exit code that reaches the caller.

## Integration Tests *(mandatory)*

- **IT-001**: Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` and verify debug-command output includes both message and command result.
- **IT-002**: Set `NO_COLOR` and verify messages are still readable without ANSI escapes.
- **IT-003**: Start and end trace mode around a command sequence and verify trace lifecycle output occurs at trace level.
- **IT-004**: Set `LOG_FORMAT=json` and verify a diagnostic with escaped
  characters parses as one JSON object.
- **IT-005**: Render progress, header, success, and progress-bar output with
  `NO_COLOR` and constrained `COLUMNS`.
- **IT-006**: Emit two events in the same process with `LOG_REQUEST_ID` unset
  and verify both carry an identical, non-empty `request_id`.
- **IT-007**: Export `LOG_REQUEST_ID` before emitting events and verify the
  supplied value is reused verbatim rather than regenerated.
- **IT-008**: Verify every structured event includes non-empty `hostname` and
  `pid` fields and a numeric, non-decreasing `duration_ms`.
- **IT-009**: Set `LOG_FILE` to a nested path that does not yet exist and
  verify the directory is created and the event is appended as JSON.
- **IT-010**: Set `LOG_FILE_LEVEL` more permissive than `LOG_LEVEL` and verify
  the file captures events suppressed on stdout.
- **IT-011**: Force `LOG_FILE` past `LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES` and verify rotation
  creates a numbered backup while pruning backups beyond
  `LOG_FILE_MAX_BACKUPS`; verify `LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES=0` disables rotation.
- **IT-012**: Call `dybatpho::log_to_file` with a nested path and
  `rotate:10M keep:3 level:debug`, and verify the file is created with mode
  `600`, the threshold is `10485760`, and a debug event reaches the file while
  stdout stays at `info`.
- **IT-013**: Call `dybatpho::log_to_file` with an unparseable size, a
  non-numeric backup count, an unknown level and an unknown setting, and
  verify each fails; then call it with `off` and verify later events reach no
  file.
- **IT-014**: Register context fields, emit a JSON event and a text event, and
  verify both carry the fields in registration order; update one field and
  verify its position is kept.
- **IT-015**: Register a context field holding a registered secret and one
  holding a quote, and verify the file line is redacted and still parses as
  JSON.
- **IT-016**: Bracket a `sleep` with `dybatpho::timer_start` and
  `dybatpho::timer_end`, and verify the message names the timer, the event
  carries `timer` and `elapsed_ms`, and `DYBATPHO_TIMER_LAST_MS` is numeric;
  verify ending an unstarted timer fails.
- **IT-017**: Run a failing command behind `dybatpho::spinner` with the
  animation disabled and verify the exit code and the command's output survive
  intact, and that a `debug` event records the elapsed time and exit code.
- **IT-018**: Force the animation with `DYBATPHO_SPINNER=always` and verify
  frames are drawn on stderr and the line is erased when the command finishes.

## Acceptance Criteria *(mandatory)*

1. The module gives dybatpho scripts a consistent logging vocabulary.
2. Operators can move from concise output to diagnostic output without changing script code.
3. Structured log events remain correlatable and auditable across processes
   and long-running sessions without requiring callers to manage IDs, file
   handles, or rotation themselves.
