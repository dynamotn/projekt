# Feature Specification: String Utilities

**Feature Branch**: `[reverse-spec-string]`
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: Existing source analysis: `src/string.sh`, `doc/string.md`, `test/string.bats`, and `example/string_ops.sh`

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Shell scripts repeatedly need trimming, splitting, exact prefix/suffix/substring checks, exact text replacement, exact prefix/suffix removal, character trimming, line counting, truncation, wrapping, blank checks, slug creation, URL-safe transformations, and case normalization, but native shell syntax for these tasks is terse and inconsistent.

## Business Value *(mandatory)*

- Give script authors predictable string primitives.
- Reduce custom parameter-expansion logic in consumer scripts.
- Make shell output normalization and URL handling easier to reuse.
- Make common exact-match string checks and replacements more readable in calling scripts.
- Keep exact affix-removal workflows inside reusable helpers instead of inline parameter expansion.
- Make shell-safe identifiers and filenames easier to derive from free-form labels.
- Cover more day-to-day formatting workflows such as truncating labels, wrapping output, and checking blank values.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Normalize user or script input (Priority: P1)

As a script author, I want to trim and case-convert values so that downstream validation and comparisons are simpler.

**Why this priority**: Normalization is a prerequisite for many other shell workflows.

**Independent Test**: Call trim, lower, and upper helpers on representative inputs and verify the returned text matches the expected normalization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** input contains surrounding whitespace, **When** the trim helper runs, **Then** leading and trailing whitespace are removed
2. **Given** input uses mixed case, **When** the lower or upper helper runs, **Then** the output is normalized to the requested case

---

### User Story 2 - Match and replace exact string fragments (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want exact-match helpers for checking and replacing string fragments so that common string conditions do not require inline parameter expansion in every caller.

**Why this priority**: Prefix, suffix, substring, and exact replacement logic are common shell tasks that fit naturally beside trim and split.

**Independent Test**: Call the matching helpers with positive, negative, and empty-pattern inputs, then verify replacement behavior for repeated matches and empty needles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an input string and a matching prefix, suffix, or substring, **When** the corresponding exact-match helper runs, **Then** it returns success
2. **Given** a string with repeated exact matches, **When** the replacement helper runs, **Then** every exact match is replaced in the output

---

### User Story 3 - Trim exact prefixes and suffixes (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want helpers that remove exact prefixes or suffixes when present so that ref names, archive names, and similar values can be normalized without repeating parameter expansion.

**Why this priority**: Exact affix trimming is a common follow-up once exact matching and replacement helpers exist.

**Independent Test**: Remove matching and non-matching prefixes and suffixes, then verify non-matching patterns leave the original string intact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an input string with a matching exact prefix, **When** the trim-prefix helper runs, **Then** the prefix is removed
2. **Given** an input string without a matching suffix, **When** the trim-suffix helper runs, **Then** the original string is returned unchanged

---

### User Story 4 - Create shell-friendly slugs (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want a slugify helper so that titles, labels, and names can be turned into predictable lowercase identifiers for files, URLs, or tags.

**Why this priority**: Slug creation is a common string cleanup workflow that complements trim and case-conversion helpers.

**Independent Test**: Slugify strings containing punctuation, spaces, underscores, and mixed case, then verify separators collapse and digits remain.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an input string with spaces and punctuation, **When** the slugify helper runs, **Then** the output is lowercase and separated with single hyphens
2. **Given** an input string made only of separator characters, **When** the slugify helper runs, **Then** the output is empty

---

### User Story 5 - Repeat and pad shell strings (Priority: P2)

As a script author, I want helpers to repeat text and pad strings to a minimum width so that I can generate simple banners, separators, and aligned output without manual loops.

**Why this priority**: Repeat and pad are small but common presentation helpers that complement the rest of the string module.

**Independent Test**: Repeat short text for positive and zero counts, then pad strings with default and custom pad tokens.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an input string and a positive repeat count, **When** the repeat helper runs, **Then** the output contains the input repeated exactly that many times
2. **Given** an input string shorter than the requested width, **When** the pad helper runs, **Then** the output is extended on the right to the requested width

---

### User Story 6 - Encode and decode URL-safe values (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want URL encode/decode helpers so that scripts can safely pass query or path values across HTTP boundaries.

**Why this priority**: Network-facing scripts frequently need portable encoding behavior.

**Independent Test**: Encode and decode strings containing spaces, reserved characters, and plus signs, then verify round-trip behavior where applicable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a string contains reserved URL characters, **When** the encode helper runs, **Then** reserved characters are percent-encoded
2. **Given** an encoded string contains `%` sequences and plus signs, **When** the decode helper runs, **Then** the caller receives a decoded value with spaces handled correctly

---

### Example Workflow

```bash
raw="  Release Notes: v1.5.0 (Beta)  "
title="$(dybatpho::trim "${raw}")"

slug="$(dybatpho::string_slugify "${title}")"        # release-notes-v1-5-0-beta
dybatpho::info "writing ${slug}.md"

if dybatpho::string_starts_with "${title}" "Release"; then
  body="$(dybatpho::string_trim_prefix "${title}" "Release Notes: ")"
  dybatpho::info "$(dybatpho::string_truncate "${body}" 10)"
fi

query="q=$(dybatpho::url_encode "${title}")"
printf '%s\n' "$(dybatpho::string_pad "name" 12)|$(dybatpho::upper "${slug}")"
```

## Edge Cases

- The input string is empty.
- The delimiter used for splitting is multi-character or empty.
- Exact-match helpers receive empty prefixes, suffixes, substrings, or replacement needles.
- Exact affix trimming receives matching, non-matching, or empty prefixes and suffixes.
- Slug creation receives punctuation-heavy or separator-only input.
- Repeat counts may be zero or negative.
- Padding tokens may be omitted, empty, or longer than one character.
- Wrapping may receive blank input or a width smaller than one word.
- Encoding input contains reserved or unreserved URL characters.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-021**: The module MUST provide a wrapping helper for width-limited output.

- **FR-022**: The module MUST convert a string to `snake_case`, `kebab-case`, `camelCase`, and `PascalCase`, accepting input written in any of those conventions or separated by whitespace or punctuation.

- **FR-022b**: Word splitting MUST keep a digit attached to the word before it, and MUST return nothing for input holding no letters or digits.
- **FR-023**: The module MUST provide a helper that quotes a value so the shell reads it back as one literal, including the empty string, for use in shell code that will be evaluated later.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
