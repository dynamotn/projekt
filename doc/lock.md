## ✨ Overview

This module provides a portable file lock (Linux/macOS) built on the
atomicity of `mkdir`, so it works the same way without depending on
`flock`, which isn't shipped by default on macOS.


A lock is a directory containing metadata about the process holding it
(pid, hostname, command, and acquisition time), which lets callers:


- prevent two runs of the same script from executing concurrently
- wait for a lock with a timeout instead of failing immediately
- inspect which process currently holds a lock
- detect and reclaim stale locks left behind by a dead process

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_LOCK_DIR`** | string | Base directory used to resolve lock names into lock paths |
| **`DYBATPHO_LOCK_POLL_INTERVAL`** | number | Seconds to sleep between acquire attempts while waiting |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`dybatpho::lock_hostname`](#dybatpholock_hostname) — Print the current host name using whichever mechanism is available. Kept as the name a lock file is stamped with; the detection itself lives in `dybatpho::hostname`.
- [`dybatpho::lock_path`](#dybatpholock_path) — Resolve a lock name or path into an absolute lock directory path.
- [`dybatpho::lock_field`](#dybatpholock_field) — Read a single metadata field recorded for a lock.
- [`dybatpho::lock_is_alive`](#dybatpholock_is_alive) — Return success when the process that owns a lock is still alive on this host.
- [`dybatpho::lock_is_held`](#dybatpholock_is_held) — Return success when a lock is currently held by a live process.
- [`dybatpho::lock_info`](#dybatpholock_info) — Print information about the process currently holding a lock.
- [`dybatpho::lock_reclaim_stale`](#dybatpholock_reclaim_stale) — Remove a lock directory left behind by a process that is no longer running.
- [`dybatpho::lock_acquire`](#dybatpholock_acquire) — Acquire a portable, cross-platform (Linux/macOS) file lock, waiting up to a timeout.
- [`dybatpho::lock_release`](#dybatpholock_release) — Release a lock previously acquired by the current process.
- [`dybatpho::with_lock`](#dybatphowith_lock) — Acquire a lock, run a command while holding it, then release it, even if the command fails.

## 🚀 Usage

### Prevent concurrent runs of the same script


```bash
dybatpho::lock_acquire "$(basename "$0")" || dybatpho::die "Already running"
trap 'dybatpho::lock_release "$(basename "$0")"' EXIT
```


### Wait up to 30s for a lock, then run a command while holding it


```bash
dybatpho::with_lock "deploy" 30 -- ./deploy.sh
```


### Inspect who is holding a lock


```bash
dybatpho::lock_info "deploy"
```

## 💡 Tips

### `dybatpho::lock_acquire`

- Uses `mkdir` for atomic lock creation, so no dependency on `flock` is required
- Pair with `dybatpho::lock_release` in a trap so the lock is always freed on exit

### `dybatpho::lock_release`

- Safe to call even when the lock was never acquired by this process

## 📚 Reference

### `dybatpho::lock_hostname`

Print the current host name using whichever mechanism is available.
  Kept as the name a lock file is stamped with; the detection itself lives in
  `dybatpho::hostname`.

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Host name reported by `hostname`, `uname -n`, the kernel, or the `HOSTNAME` env var


---

### `dybatpho::lock_path`

Resolve a lock name or path into an absolute lock directory path.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Lock name (bare word) or an explicit absolute/relative path |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Absolute lock directory path, always suffixed with `.lock`


---

### `dybatpho::lock_field`

Read a single metadata field recorded for a lock.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Lock directory path |
| `$2` | string | Field name (pid\|host\|command\|acquired_at) |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Recorded value, or empty when the lock or field doesn't exist


---

### `dybatpho::lock_is_alive`

Return success when the process that owns a lock is still alive on this host.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Lock directory path |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The recorded pid belongs to a live process on the current host
- `1`: The lock is missing, foreign to this host, or its process is gone (stale)


---

### `dybatpho::lock_is_held`

Return success when a lock is currently held by a live process.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Lock name or path |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The lock exists and is held by a live process
- `1`: The lock doesn't exist or is stale


---

### `dybatpho::lock_info`

Print information about the process currently holding a lock.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Lock name or path |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- `pid=<pid> host=<host> acquired_at=<timestamp> command=<command>` when held

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The lock is currently held and its info was printed
- `1`: The lock isn't held by anyone


---

### `dybatpho::lock_reclaim_stale`

Remove a lock directory left behind by a process that is no longer running.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Lock directory path |

**📤 Output on stderr**

- Notice when a stale lock is reclaimed


---

### `dybatpho::lock_acquire`

Acquire a portable, cross-platform (Linux/macOS) file lock, waiting up to a timeout.

dybatpho::lock_acquire "deploy" 30

### `dybatpho::lock_release`
