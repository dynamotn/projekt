## ✨ Overview

A script that asks a slow question more than once -- an API listing, a
dependency resolution, a `--version` probe across a fleet -- ends up writing
the same four lines: work out a file name, check how old the file is,
compare that against a number of seconds, and remember to create the
directory. `dybatpho::file_age_seconds` even documents that shape as its own
example. This module is that shape, written once.


The centre of it is `dybatpho::cache_run`, which memoizes what a command
prints:


```sh
releases="$(dybatpho::cache_run gh-releases 3600 -- gh api /repos/o/r/releases)"
```


A failing command is never stored. Caching a failure turns one bad minute
into an hour of them, and the caller cannot tell the difference between a
remembered error and a fresh one.


Entries are written through `dybatpho::file_write_atomic`, so a reader sees
either the previous entry or the complete new one, never half of a write in
progress.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_DIR`** | string | Directory holding cache entries, default is the XDG cache directory for `dybatpho` |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_NAMESPACE`** | string | Subdirectory grouping related entries, default is `default`; empty puts entries directly in the cache directory |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_TTL`** | number | Seconds an entry stays fresh when a call does not say, default is `3600` |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`dybatpho::cache_dir`](#dybatphocache_dir) — Print the directory entries are written to. This is `DYBATPHO_CACHE_DIR` with the namespace below it, or the cache directory itself when the namespace is empty.
- [`dybatpho::cache_key`](#dybatphocache_key) — Turn any values into a key that is safe as a file name. Call this when the thing that identifies an entry is a URL, a request body, or anything else that is not already a short name.
- [`dybatpho::cache_path`](#dybatphocache_path) — Print the path an entry is stored at.
- [`dybatpho::cache_has`](#dybatphocache_has) — Return success when an entry exists and is still fresh. An entry is fresh while `age < ttl`, so a time to live of one hour means an entry lives one hour. `0` therefore makes nothing fresh, which is the way to force a refresh without deleting anything. There is no value meaning "never expires": an entry that never goes stale is a file, and `dybatpho::file_write_atomic` writes those.
- [`dybatpho::cache_get`](#dybatphocache_get) — Print an entry when it is still fresh.
- [`dybatpho::cache_set`](#dybatphocache_set) — Store standard input as an entry. The write goes through `dybatpho::file_write_atomic`, so a reader sees the previous entry or the whole new one, and two writers cannot interleave.
- [`dybatpho::cache_forget`](#dybatphocache_forget) — Remove one entry.
- [`dybatpho::cache_clear`](#dybatphocache_clear) — Remove every entry in the current namespace. Only files this module wrote are removed, recognised by their suffix. The cache directory is named by an environment variable, and emptying whatever a path happens to contain is not a thing a helper should offer to do.
- [`dybatpho::cache_run`](#dybatphocache_run) — Print what a command prints, running it only when the remembered answer has gone stale. This is the whole module in one call: ask once, reuse the answer until it expires, and put the command's own output through unchanged either way. A command that fails is not stored, and its exit status is returned as it is. Remembering a failure would turn one bad minute into a whole time to live of them, and the caller could not tell a remembered error from a fresh one. Standard error is not captured either way, so a warning the command prints is seen every time rather than once.

## 📚 Reference

### `dybatpho::cache_dir`

Print the directory entries are written to.
  This is `DYBATPHO_CACHE_DIR` with the namespace below it, or the cache
  directory itself when the namespace is empty.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::cache_dir                                   # ~/.cache/dybatpho/default
DYBATPHO_CACHE_NAMESPACE=gh dybatpho::cache_dir        # ~/.cache/dybatpho/gh

```

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_DIR`** | string | Directory holding cache entries |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_NAMESPACE`** | string | Subdirectory grouping related entries |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The directory entries live in


---

### `dybatpho::cache_key`

Turn any values into a key that is safe as a file name.
  Call this when the thing that identifies an entry is a URL, a request body,
  or anything else that is not already a short name.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
key="$(dybatpho::cache_key "${url}" "${token_owner}")"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$@` | string | Values identifying the entry; each is hashed in order |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- A hexadecimal key

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script when no value is given or no hashing command exists


---

### `dybatpho::cache_path`

Print the path an entry is stored at.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::cache_path releases

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Entry key |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_DIR`** | string | Directory holding cache entries |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_NAMESPACE`** | string | Subdirectory grouping related entries |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The path of the entry, whether or not it exists

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script when the key cannot be a file name


---

### `dybatpho::cache_has`

Return success when an entry exists and is still fresh.
  An entry is fresh while `age < ttl`, so a time to live of one hour means an
  entry lives one hour. `0` therefore makes nothing fresh, which is the way to
  force a refresh without deleting anything. There is no value meaning "never
  expires": an entry that never goes stale is a file, and
  `dybatpho::file_write_atomic` writes those.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
if dybatpho::cache_has releases 3600; then ... ; fi

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Entry key |
| `$2` | number | Seconds the entry stays fresh, default is `DYBATPHO_CACHE_TTL` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_TTL`** | number | Default time to live |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The entry exists and is fresh
- `1`: There is no entry, or it is older than the time to live


---

### `dybatpho::cache_get`

Print an entry when it is still fresh.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
if body="$(dybatpho::cache_get releases 3600)"; then
  dybatpho::debug "Using the remembered listing"
fi

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Entry key |
| `$2` | number | Seconds the entry stays fresh, default is `DYBATPHO_CACHE_TTL` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |

| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_TTL`** | number | Default time to live |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The stored entry

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: A fresh entry was printed
- `1`: There is no entry, or it is older than the time to live

---

### `dybatpho::cache_set`

Store standard input as an entry.
  The write goes through `dybatpho::file_write_atomic`, so a reader sees the
  previous entry or the whole new one, and two writers cannot interleave.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
printf '%s\n' "${body}" | dybatpho::cache_set releases

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Entry key |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_DIR`** | string | Directory holding cache entries |
| **`DRY_RUN`** | string | When true-like, report the write instead of performing it |

**📥 Input on stdin**

- The content to store

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The entry was written
- `1`: Stop the script when the key cannot be a file name or the write fails


---

### `dybatpho::cache_forget`

Remove one entry.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::cache_forget releases

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Entry key |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The entry is gone, whether or not it was there
- `1`: Stop the script when the key cannot be a file name


---

### `dybatpho::cache_clear`

Remove every entry in the current namespace.
  Only files this module wrote are removed, recognised by their suffix. The
  cache directory is named by an environment variable, and emptying whatever
  a path happens to contain is not a thing a helper should offer to do.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::cache_clear
DYBATPHO_CACHE_NAMESPACE=gh dybatpho::cache_clear

```

_Function has no arguments._

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_DIR`** | string | Directory holding cache entries |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_NAMESPACE`** | string | Namespace to empty |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The namespace holds no entries, whether or not it did before


---

### `dybatpho::cache_run`

Print what a command prints, running it only when the remembered
  answer has gone stale.
  This is the whole module in one call: ask once, reuse the answer until it
  expires, and put the command's own output through unchanged either way.


  A command that fails is not stored, and its exit status is returned as it
  is. Remembering a failure would turn one bad minute into a whole time to
  live of them, and the caller could not tell a remembered error from a fresh
  one. Standard error is not captured either way, so a warning the command
  prints is seen every time rather than once.

**🧪 Examples**

```bash
releases="$(dybatpho::cache_run gh-releases 3600 -- gh api /repos/o/r/releases)"

```

```bash
# Without a time to live, DYBATPHO_CACHE_TTL decides.
dybatpho::cache_run tags -- git ls-remote --tags origin

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Entry key |
| `$2` | number | Optional seconds the entry stays fresh, before `--` |
| `$@` | string | `--` followed by the command and its arguments |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_CACHE_TTL`** | number | Default time to live |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The command's output, from the entry or from running it

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The output came from a fresh entry, or the command succeeded
- `other`: The command failed, with its own exit status, and nothing was stored
- `1`: Stop the script when no command is given after `--`
