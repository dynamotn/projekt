## ✨ Overview

This module records how long a script spends in a command, how often it
retried, and how many errors it hit, then renders the result in the
Prometheus text exposition format.


Metrics live in the current shell only. Nothing is sent anywhere: a script
writes the rendered text to a file, and a collector such as the node
exporter's textfile collector picks it up. `dybatpho::metrics_write` writes
that file atomically, which is what the textfile collector requires in order
never to read a half-written file.


Durations are handled in whole milliseconds, because Bash has no floating
point arithmetic, and rendered in seconds, because that is the unit
Prometheus expects.


Loading this module also turns on the instrumentation that `helpers`,
`network`, and `logging` offer: retries, HTTP requests, and logged errors
are counted without the script asking for it.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_METRICS_BUCKETS_MS`** | string | Comma-separated histogram bucket bounds in milliseconds |
| **`DYBATPHO_METRICS_LAST_MS`** | number | Elapsed milliseconds published by the timing helpers |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_metrics_validate_name`](#__dybatpho_metrics_validate_name) — Fail unless a string is a valid Prometheus metric or label name.
- [`__dybatpho_metrics_sort`](#__dybatpho_metrics_sort) — Sort an array in place, in Bash. `__log` calls into this module, and `__log` has to keep working where `PATH` is restricted, so nothing here may depend on an external command.
- [`__dybatpho_metrics_labels`](#__dybatpho_metrics_labels) — Turn `key=value` arguments into a rendered Prometheus label set. Labels are sorted so that the same set always produces the same series key, whatever order the caller passed them in.
- [`__dybatpho_metrics_key`](#__dybatpho_metrics_key) — Build the storage key for one series. The key is returned through a variable rather than standard output, because a command substitution would validate inside a subshell, where a rejected name or label could not stop the caller from recording the series anyway.
- [`__dybatpho_metrics_declare`](#__dybatpho_metrics_declare) — Record the type and help text of a metric, the first time it is seen.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_help`](#dybatphometrics_help) — Describe a metric, so that the exported text explains it.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_counter_inc`](#dybatphometrics_counter_inc) — Add to a counter, a value that only ever grows.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_gauge_set`](#dybatphometrics_gauge_set) — Set a gauge, a value that can go up and down.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_observe_ms`](#dybatphometrics_observe_ms) — Record one duration in a histogram. The value is taken in milliseconds because that is what Bash can measure with integer arithmetic, and exported in seconds because that is what Prometheus expects.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_timer_start`](#dybatphometrics_timer_start) — Start a named timer.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_timer_stop`](#dybatphometrics_timer_stop) — Stop a timer, record its duration, and print the elapsed milliseconds.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_time`](#dybatphometrics_time) — Run a command, record how long it took, and pass its exit code on. The duration is recorded whether the command succeeded or not, and a failure also increments a failure counter named after the metric, so that a dashboard can show latency and error rate from the same run: `deploy_duration_seconds` pairs with `deploy_failures_total`.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_get`](#dybatphometrics_get) — Read one series back, for a script that branches on its own measurements and for tests.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_reset`](#dybatphometrics_reset) — Forget every recorded metric.
- [`__dybatpho_metrics_seconds`](#__dybatpho_metrics_seconds) — Render whole milliseconds as the seconds value Prometheus expects.
- [`__dybatpho_metrics_series`](#__dybatpho_metrics_series) — Rewrite a series key with a name suffix and an optional extra label. `http_duration{host="a"}` becomes `http_duration_bucket{host="a",le="0.5"}`.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_render`](#dybatphometrics_render) — Render every recorded metric in the Prometheus text exposition format.
- [`__dybatpho_metrics_keys_of`](#__dybatpho_metrics_keys_of) — Print the series keys of one metric, in a stable order.
- [`dybatpho::metrics_write`](#dybatphometrics_write) — Write the rendered metrics to a file, atomically. The node exporter's textfile collector reads whatever it finds whenever it scrapes, so the file has to appear complete or not at all.

## 💡 Tips

### `__dybatpho_metrics_key`

- The hooks in `helpers`, `logging`, and `network` test for this function to decide whether metrics are recordable. It is internal, so it never crosses a process boundary, which is exactly what makes it the right marker: a child shell inherits the exported `dybatpho::metrics_*` functions but not the helpers they call, and a guard on a public name would take the recording branch there and fail. Renaming this function means updating those guards.

### `dybatpho::metrics_timer_stop`

- The elapsed time is published in `DYBATPHO_METRICS_LAST_MS` rather than printed, because capturing output with `$(...)` would run the call in a subshell and throw away the measurement it just recorded

### `dybatpho::metrics_render`

- Durations are exported in seconds, so a metric name ending in `_seconds` reads correctly on a dashboard

| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Name of the array variable to sort |


---

### `__dybatpho_metrics_labels`

Turn `key=value` arguments into a rendered Prometheus label set.

---

### `__dybatpho_metrics_key`

### `dybatpho::metrics_time`

Run a command, record how long it took, and pass its exit code on.
  The duration is recorded whether the command succeeded or not, and a failure

### `dybatpho::metrics_write`

Write the rendered metrics to a file, atomically.
  The node exporter's textfile collector reads whatever it finds whenever it
  scrapes, so the file has to appear complete or not at all.

**🧪 Example**
