## ✨ Overview

This module extends the plain `dybatpho::assert` guard from `helpers.sh`
with the pieces a shell test suite usually has to hand-roll:


- assertions for files, directories, symlinks, permissions, JSON, and YAML
- snapshot testing for CLI output, including exit code and stderr
- mocks for environment variables, external commands, and HTTP responses
- fixtures that register themselves for `trap`-based cleanup on exit


Assertions never terminate the shell. They write a diagnostic to stderr and
return `1`, so they compose with `if`, `&&`, and the Bats `run` helper.
Only programming mistakes, such as a missing argument, are fatal.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |

| **`DYBATPHO_TEST_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS`** | string | Set to `true`, `yes`, or `on` to rewrite snapshots instead of comparing them |
| **`DYBATPHO_TEST_FAILURES`** | number | Count of assertion failures recorded in this shell |

## 🚀 Usage

### Assert on a generated file


```bash
dybatpho::assert_file "dist/app.tgz"
dybatpho::assert_file_mode "${HOME}/.netrc" 600
```

## 💡 Tips

### `__dybatpho_test_input_file`

- This assigns through a name reference instead of printing, so the cleanup trap registered for a buffered stdin fixture is not discarded with a command substitution.

### `__dybatpho_test_mock_init`

- This must run in the calling shell, never inside `$(...)`, or the `PATH` change is discarded with the subshell.

### `dybatpho::assert_file_mode`

- Useful for verifying that secret files are not group- or world-readable

### `__dybatpho_test_scalar_matches`

- Backends print string scalars as `"value"`, so both `value` and `"value"` are accepted as the expected form.

### `dybatpho::assert_json_query`

- String scalars are compared without their JSON quoting, so an expected value of `1.4.2` matches a backend result of `"1.4.2"`.

### `dybatpho::assert_yaml_query`

- String scalars are compared without their JSON quoting, so an expected value of `1.4.2` matches a backend result of `"1.4.2"`.

### `dybatpho::snapshot_scrub`

- Use this to remove timestamps, temporary paths, and process ids that would otherwise make a snapshot fail on every run.

### `dybatpho::assert_snapshot`

- A missing snapshot is written and passes, so the first run records the baseline.
- Trailing blank lines are not preserved, because the text passes through a command substitution; a snapshot cannot assert on them.

### `dybatpho::assert_cli_snapshot`

- The command's own exit code is recorded inside the snapshot rather than propagated, so a CLI that exits non-zero can still be snapshotted.

### `dybatpho::mock_env`

- Variables that were unset before the mock are unset again on restore, rather than being left behind as empty strings.

### `dybatpho::mock_command_script`

- The mock is a real executable on `PATH`, so it also intercepts `command <name>`, which is how the network module invokes `curl`.

### `dybatpho::assert_mock_called`

- Arguments are matched on whole-argument boundaries, so a fragment of an argument never counts as a match.

### `dybatpho::mock_http`

- The mock replaces `curl` itself, so it also covers `command curl` calls made by `dybatpho::curl_do` and every helper built on it.
- Following the repository's curl-stubbing convention, the mock always exits `0` and reports the status through `-w '%{http_code}'`, which is what the network module reads to decide success, retry, and its own exit code.

### `dybatpho::fixture_dir`

- Cleanup is registered through `dybatpho::cleanup_file_on_exit`, so the fixture is removed by an `EXIT`/`HUP`/`INT`/`TERM` trap even when the script fails.

### `dybatpho::fixture_file`

- When reading content from stdin, redirect into the call (`< file` or `<<<`) instead of piping into it. A pipeline runs the helper in a subshell, so the assigned variable would not survive in the caller.

### `dybatpho::unmock_all`

- Fixtures and mocks are already removed by their exit traps; call this to reset state between test cases that share one shell.
