## ✨ Overview

This module turns an LLM into an ordinary shell dependency: one function
call in, text on stdout, a non-zero exit code when something fails. It
speaks four backends behind a single API:


- **anthropic** – Claude Messages API (`/v1/messages`)
- **openai** – any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
  (OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, vLLM, LM Studio, ...)
- **ollama** – a local Ollama daemon, no API key required
- **cli** – an already installed command line client (`claude`, `llm`,
  `ollama`), for machines where the key never leaves the tool that owns it


On top of the transport it provides the things a script actually needs
around a model call: multi-turn conversations stored in a file, structured
JSON output validated against a schema, token streaming, a tool-use loop
that runs shell functions, response caching, redaction of secrets before
anything is sent, and a call budget that stops a runaway loop.

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_ai_require_json`](#__dybatpho_ai_require_json) — Fail loudly when no JSON backend is installed.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_redact`](#__dybatpho_ai_redact) — Mask registered secrets in text before it leaves the machine.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_state_cleanup_once`](#__dybatpho_ai_state_cleanup_once) — Arrange for the counter file to be removed when the script ends. Sourcing a module must not touch the host script's traps, so this runs on first use rather than at load time. A command substitution gets its own process, and a handler registered there would delete the counters the moment that subshell returned, so only the top-level shell registers one.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_state_read`](#__dybatpho_ai_state_read) — Print the counter document, creating it on first use.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_state_write`](#__dybatpho_ai_state_write) — Replace the counter document.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_budget_check`](#__dybatpho_ai_budget_check) — Stop the script when the call budget is already used up. This is deliberately separate from counting: the count happens deep inside a command substitution, where an `exit` would only leave that subshell, so the refusal has to be raised by the public function the caller invoked.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_count_call`](#__dybatpho_ai_count_call) — Count one model call in the shared counter file.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_record_usage`](#__dybatpho_ai_record_usage) — Record the token usage a provider reported for one call.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_ollama_alive`](#__dybatpho_ai_ollama_alive) — Return success when an Ollama daemon answers on the base URL.
- [`dybatpho::ai_provider`](#dybatphoai_provider) — Resolve which backend a call will use. Detection order for `auto`: an Anthropic key, an OpenAI key, a live local Ollama daemon, then any supported command line client.
- [`dybatpho::ai_model`](#dybatphoai_model) — Resolve the model identifier for the active backend.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_api_key`](#__dybatpho_ai_api_key) — Resolve the API key for an HTTP backend.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_base_url`](#__dybatpho_ai_base_url) — Resolve the base URL of an HTTP backend.
- [`dybatpho::ai_check`](#dybatphoai_check) — Report whether the module can run, without making a request. Checks the JSON backend, the transport command, and the credentials of the active backend.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_cli_command`](#__dybatpho_ai_cli_command) — Resolve the command used by the `cli` backend.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_conversation_build`](#__dybatpho_ai_conversation_build) — Build a conversation document from a system prompt and turns. The document is the provider-neutral shape the payload builders consume.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_payload_anthropic`](#__dybatpho_ai_payload_anthropic) — Render a conversation document into an Anthropic request body.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_payload_openai`](#__dybatpho_ai_payload_openai) — Render a conversation document into an OpenAI-compatible body.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_messages_with_system`](#__dybatpho_ai_messages_with_system) — Prepend the system prompt as a message, the way the OpenAI-compatible and Ollama APIs expect it.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_tools_as_functions`](#__dybatpho_ai_tools_as_functions) — Convert the neutral tool list into the OpenAI function shape, which both OpenAI-compatible endpoints and Ollama accept.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_payload_ollama`](#__dybatpho_ai_payload_ollama) — Render a conversation document into an Ollama chat body.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_cache_key`](#__dybatpho_ai_cache_key) — Compute the cache key of a request.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_cache_read`](#__dybatpho_ai_cache_read) — Print a cached response when one is present and still fresh.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_cache_write`](#__dybatpho_ai_cache_write) — Store a response body in the cache.
- [`dybatpho::ai_cache_clear`](#dybatphoai_cache_clear) — Forget every cached response.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_dry_run_body`](#__dybatpho_ai_dry_run_body) — Produce a provider-shaped placeholder response for `DRY_RUN`. Keeping the shape lets the rest of the pipeline run unchanged, so an example or a rehearsal exercises the real extraction and accounting code.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_http`](#__dybatpho_ai_http) — Send one request to an HTTP backend and print the raw response.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_assert_no_error`](#__dybatpho_ai_assert_no_error) — Stop the script when a provider response carries an error object.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_extract_text`](#__dybatpho_ai_extract_text) — Extract the assistant text from a provider response.

- [`__dybatpho_ai_complete`](#__dybatpho_ai_complete) — Complete a conversation and print the assistant text. This is the single funnel every public helper goes through.
- [`dybatpho::ai_ask`](#dybatphoai_ask) — Ask the model a single question and print its answer.
- [`dybatpho::ai_conversation_new`](#dybatphoai_conversation_new) — Create a conversation file and store its path in a variable. The file is registered for cleanup when the script exits.
- [`dybatpho::ai_conversation_add`](#dybatphoai_conversation_add) — Append a turn to a conversation file.
- [`dybatpho::ai_conversation_show`](#dybatphoai_conversation_show) — Print a conversation as readable transcript lines.
- [`dybatpho::ai_chat`](#dybatphoai_chat) — Send the next turn of a stored conversation and record the reply. Both the question and the answer are appended to the file, so the next call carries the full history.
- [`dybatpho::ai_json`](#dybatphoai_json) — Ask for an answer that matches a JSON schema, and validate it. Backends with native structured output are told about the schema; the rest are asked in the prompt. Either way the answer is parsed and re-checked locally, and the call is retried when the model returns something unusable.
- [`dybatpho::ai_stream`](#dybatphoai_stream) — Ask a question and print the answer as it is generated. Falls back to a normal buffered call on backends without a token stream.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_stream_chunk`](#__dybatpho_ai_stream_chunk) — Print one streamed delta without adding a line break. The JSON backends both terminate their output with a newline, which would turn a stream of fragments into a column of them, so exactly one trailing newline is removed while any the model actually produced are kept.
- [`dybatpho::ai_tool_register`](#dybatphoai_tool_register) — Register a shell function the model may call during `ai_run`.
- [`dybatpho::ai_tool_list`](#dybatphoai_tool_list) — Print the names of registered tools, one per line.
- [`dybatpho::ai_tool_clear`](#dybatphoai_tool_clear) — Unregister every tool.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_tools_json`](#__dybatpho_ai_tools_json) — Render the tool registry as a provider-neutral tools array.
- [`__dybatpho_ai_tool_invoke`](#__dybatpho_ai_tool_invoke) — Run one registered tool and print what it wrote. A failing handler is not fatal: its output is returned to the model as an error result so the model can adapt, which is the documented contract for tool results.
- [`dybatpho::ai_run`](#dybatphoai_run) — Answer a prompt, letting the model call registered tools first. The loop sends the prompt, runs whatever tools the model asks for, feeds the results back, and repeats until the model answers in text or the step limit is reached.
- [`dybatpho::ai_tokens_estimate`](#dybatphoai_tokens_estimate) — Estimate how many tokens a piece of text costs. The estimate is four characters per token, which is close enough to size a prompt or decide whether to truncate before a call; it is not a billing figure.
- [`dybatpho::ai_usage`](#dybatphoai_usage) — Print the token usage recorded so far.
- [`dybatpho::ai_usage_field`](#dybatphoai_usage_field) — Read one usage counter as a bare value.
- [`dybatpho::ai_usage_reset`](#dybatphoai_usage_reset) — Reset every usage counter and the call budget consumption.
- [`dybatpho::ai_budget`](#dybatphoai_budget) — Cap how many model calls the rest of the script may make.
- [`dybatpho::ai_redact`](#dybatphoai_redact) — Redact secrets and common personal identifiers in text. Registered secrets are masked first, then email addresses, IPv4 addresses, and long digit runs are replaced with placeholders.

## 🚀 Usage

### When to use this module


Use `ai.sh` when you want to:


- summarize a log, a diff, or a test failure inside a pipeline
- classify or extract fields from unstructured text into JSON
- draft a release note or a commit message from real repository data
- give a maintenance script a natural language front end


### Common patterns


#### Ask a one-shot question


```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
dybatpho::ai_ask "Summarize this log in three bullets"
dybatpho::ai_ask "What broke?" "You are a terse SRE assistant"
```


#### Get machine-readable output


```bash
schema='{"type":"object","properties":{"severity":{"type":"string"}},
         "required":["severity"],"additionalProperties":false}'
dybatpho::ai_json "Classify this alert: ${alert}" "${schema}" > /tmp/out.json
severity=$(dybatpho::json_query /tmp/out.json '.severity')
```


#### Hold a conversation


```bash
local CHAT
dybatpho::ai_conversation_new CHAT "You are a Bash tutor"
dybatpho::ai_chat "${CHAT}" "How do I trap SIGINT?"
dybatpho::ai_chat "${CHAT}" "And clean up a temp file too?"
```


#### Let the model call your functions


```bash
function disk_free { df -h / | tail -n 1; }
dybatpho::ai_tool_register disk_free "Report free disk space" \
  '{"type":"object","properties":{}}' disk_free
dybatpho::ai_run "Are we about to run out of disk?"
```

## 💡 Tips

- Set `DYBATPHO_AI_PROVIDER` to pin a backend; the default `auto` picks the first one whose credentials or command are present
- Every prompt is passed through `dybatpho::secret_mask` first, so values registered with `dybatpho::secret_register` never reach the provider @note Payloads and responses go through the `json` module, so this needs `yq` or `jq` like the rest of the library; building them by string concatenation is too escaping-sensitive to be safe

### `dybatpho::ai_ask`

- Pipe long inputs into the prompt with a command substitution rather than as a second argument

### `dybatpho::ai_json`

- Keep schemas flat; `additionalProperties: false` plus a `required` list gives the most reliable results

### `dybatpho::ai_tool_register`

- Write the description prescriptively: say when to call the tool, not only what it does

### `dybatpho::ai_run`

- Handlers receive their arguments as one JSON string; parse it with `dybatpho::json_query`

### `dybatpho::ai_redact`

- This is a coarse net, not a compliance control; do not send regulated data to a third party provider on the strength of it

### `__dybatpho_ai_state_cleanup_once`

Arrange for the counter file to be removed when the script ends.
Sourcing a module must not touch the host script's traps, so this runs on

process, and a handler registered there would delete the counters the moment
that subshell returned, so only the top-level shell registers one.

### `dybatpho::ai_json`

Ask for an answer that matches a JSON schema, and validate it.
Backends with native structured output are told about the schema; the rest
are asked in the prompt. Either way the answer is parsed and re-checked
locally, and the call is retried when the model returns something unusable.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
schema='{"type":"object","properties":{"ok":{"type":"boolean"}},
         "required":["ok"],"additionalProperties":false}'

Falls back to a normal buffered call on backends without a token stream.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::ai_stream "Explain this stack trace" | tee /tmp/answer.txt

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Prompt |
| `$2` | string | Optional system prompt |

**📝 Notes**

- Usage counters are not updated for streamed Anthropic calls because the totals arrive in a trailing event this helper does not buffer

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The stream completed
- `1`: Missing arguments or a provider error


---

### `__dybatpho_ai_stream_chunk`

Print one streamed delta without adding a line break.
The JSON backends both terminate their output with a newline, which would
turn a stream of fragments into a column of them, so exactly one trailing
newline is removed while any the model actually produced are kept.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | One event payload |
| `$2` | string | Filter selecting the text fragment |

dybatpho::ai_tool_register service_status "Check whether a systemd unit is active" \
  '{"type":"object","properties":{"unit":{"type":"string"}},"required":["unit"]}' \
  service_status

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Tool name the model will use |
| `$2` | string | Description telling the model when to call it |
| `$3` | string | JSON schema for the tool arguments |
| `$4` | string | Shell function that implements the tool |

**🧩 Variable sets**

---

### `dybatpho::ai_tool_list`

Print the names of registered tools, one per line.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::ai_tool_list

```

_Function has no arguments._

**📤 Output on stdout**

- JSON array, `[]` when nothing is registered


---

### `__dybatpho_ai_tool_invoke`

Run one registered tool and print what it wrote.
A failing handler is not fatal: its output is returned to the model as an
error result so the model can adapt, which is the documented contract for
tool results.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Tool name |
| `$2` | string | Tool arguments as JSON |

**📤 Output on stdout**

### `dybatpho::ai_run`

Answer a prompt, letting the model call registered tools first.
The loop sends the prompt, runs whatever tools the model asks for, feeds the
results back, and repeats until the model answers in text or the step limit
is reached.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::ai_tool_register disk_free "Report free disk space" \
  '{"type":"object","properties":{}}' disk_free
dybatpho::ai_run "Do we need to clean up the build cache?"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Prompt |
| `$2` | string | Optional system prompt |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_AI_MAX_STEPS`** | number | Maximum tool rounds before giving up |

**📝 Notes**

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Final assistant answer

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The model produced a final answer
- `1`: Missing arguments, no tools registered, a provider error, or the step limit was hit


---

### `dybatpho::ai_tokens_estimate`

Estimate how many tokens a piece of text costs.
The estimate is four characters per token, which is close enough to size a
prompt or decide whether to truncate before a call; it is not a billing figure.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
if (($(dybatpho::ai_tokens_estimate "$(cat build.log)") > 100000)); then
  dybatpho::warn "Log is too large, summarizing in chunks"
fi

```

**🧾 Arguments**

---

### `dybatpho::ai_usage_field`

Read one usage counter as a bare value.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
if (($(dybatpho::ai_usage_field total_output) > 50000)); then
  dybatpho::warn "This run is getting expensive"
fi

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Field name: `calls`, `total_input`, `total_output`, `last_input`, `last_output`, `last_model`, or `last_stop_reason` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

and long digit runs are replaced with placeholders.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::ai_ask "Explain this error: $(dybatpho::ai_redact "${line}")"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Text to redact, stdin is read when omitted |
