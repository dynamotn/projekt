## ✨ Overview

This module contains functions to work with network connection, downloads,
JSON-oriented requests, and HEAD requests. It also provides multipart
uploads, resumable downloads with checksum verification, normalized
response parsing (status/headers/body), per-request timeouts, and the two
halves of calling a remote service politely: an in-memory circuit breaker
for a service that is failing, and a sliding window rate limiter for one
that is not to be called too often. On top of them sit the helpers an API
client needs anyway -- bearer authentication that keeps the token out of
`curl`'s command line, `Link`-header pagination, and a GraphQL request that
reads the errors out of a `200 OK` body.


Alongside the HTTP client it carries the primitives a script reaches for
before making a request at all: splitting a URL into its parts, deciding
whether a string is an address or a network, whether an address is inside
one, and whether a port is accepting connections yet. These are the checks
that otherwise get written inline as a regex that nearly works — the kind
that accepts `192.0.2.256`, or reads `127.0.0.010` as a different host than
the resolver does.

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_network_config_escape`](#__dybatpho_network_config_escape) — Escape a value for a double-quoted `curl` config parameter. `curl` reads a config file as `name = "value"`, where the value takes backslash escapes, so a backslash or a quote inside a header has to be escaped or it ends the value early.
- [`__dybatpho_network_secret_config`](#__dybatpho_network_secret_config) — Write the secret headers of the current request into a private config file for `curl --config`. The file is created under `umask 077` before anything is written to it, so the credential is never on disk in a mode another account could read, and it is removed as soon as the request is over. The path is an argument, which is public; the contents are not.
- [`__dybatpho_network_get_http_code`](#__dybatpho_network_get_http_code) — Get description of HTTP status code
- [`dybatpho::curl_do`](#dybatphocurl_do) — Transferring data with URL by curl
- [`dybatpho::curl_download`](#dybatphocurl_download) — Download file
- [`dybatpho::curl_json`](#dybatphocurl_json) — Transfer JSON data with URL by curl.
- [`dybatpho::curl_head`](#dybatphocurl_head) — Fetch only HTTP headers for a URL by curl.
- [`dybatpho::curl_upload`](#dybatphocurl_upload) — Upload fields and files with curl using multipart/form-data.
- [`dybatpho::verify_checksum`](#dybatphoverify_checksum) — Verify a downloaded file against an expected checksum.
- [`dybatpho::curl_resume_download`](#dybatphocurl_resume_download) — Download a file with resume support and optional checksum verification.
- [`dybatpho::curl_parse_response`](#dybatphocurl_parse_response) — Parse a raw curl header dump (and optional body file) into normalized response state.
- [`dybatpho::curl_response_header`](#dybatphocurl_response_header) — Print a normalized response header captured by `dybatpho::curl_parse_response`.
- [`dybatpho::curl_request`](#dybatphocurl_request) — Perform a request via `dybatpho::curl_do` and parse its response into normalized status/header/body state.
- [`dybatpho::curl_timeout`](#dybatphocurl_timeout) — Perform a request via `dybatpho::curl_do` with connect/total timeouts scoped to this call only.
- [`dybatpho::circuit_state`](#dybatphocircuit_state) — Report whether a circuit breaker key is currently open, half-open, or closed.
- [`dybatpho::circuit_reset`](#dybatphocircuit_reset) — Reset a circuit breaker key back to the closed state.
- [`dybatpho::circuit_breaker`](#dybatphocircuit_breaker) — Run a shell command guarded by a circuit breaker keyed by name.
- [`__dybatpho_network_rate_spec`](#__dybatpho_network_rate_spec) — Parse a rate limit spec into a call budget and a window length. The spec is written the way a rate limit is spoken -- `10/60` is ten calls a minute -- and the window takes an optional unit so that `10/1m` and `5/500ms` mean what they look like.
- [`__dybatpho_network_rate_prune`](#__dybatpho_network_rate_prune) — Drop the timestamps that have fallen out of a key's window, and report how many calls it has left.
- [`dybatpho::rate_limit_remaining`](#dybatphorate_limit_remaining) — Report how many calls a rate limit key has left in its window.
- [`dybatpho::rate_limit_reset`](#dybatphorate_limit_reset) — Forget every call recorded against a rate limit key.
- [`dybatpho::rate_limit`](#dybatphorate_limit) — Run a command under a sliding window rate limit keyed by name. The limiter is the other half of `dybatpho::circuit_breaker`: the breaker stops calling a service that is already failing, and this stops calling one that is working faster than it agreed to be called. An API that answers `429` for the rest of the hour once a script has spent its budget is not made better by retrying -- it is made better by not spending the budget in the first place. A window holds the timestamps of the calls made inside it. While the budget has room the command runs immediately; when it is full the limiter waits exactly until the oldest call leaves the window, and then runs. Nothing is dropped, so a loop over five hundred items still finishes -- it finishes at the rate the spec allows.
- [`dybatpho::curl_link`](#dybatphocurl_link) — Print the URL of one relation of the last response's `Link` header. A `Link` header is a comma-separated list of `<url>; rel="next"` entries, and one `rel` may name several relations at once, as in `rel="next last"`. A caller that matches `rel="next"` as a substring gets the first of those right and the second wrong.
- [`dybatpho::curl_paginate`](#dybatphocurl_paginate) — Fetch every page of a paginated resource, following the `Link` header's `next` relation, and print each page's body to standard output. Paging is the part of an API client that gets written once per script and wrong once per script: the loop that misses the last page, the one that rebuilds `?page=N` by hand when the server already said where the next page is, the one that never stops because the server repeats itself. This follows what the server sent, stops when it stops offering a next page, and refuses to visit the same URL twice.
- [`dybatpho::curl_auth_bearer`](#dybatphocurl_auth_bearer) — Make a request carrying a bearer token, without putting the token on `curl`'s command line. `--header "Authorization: Bearer ..."` publishes the token in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, which every account on the host can read for as long as the request runs, and which `ps auxww` prints. The token goes through `DYBATPHO_CURL_SECRET_HEADERS` instead, which `dybatpho::curl_do` writes to a private config file and removes again afterwards.
- [`dybatpho::curl_graphql`](#dybatphocurl_graphql) — Post a GraphQL query and report the errors the response carries. A GraphQL endpoint answers `200 OK` and puts the failure in the body, so a script that only checks the status code reads "the field you asked for does not exist" as a successful request. This builds the `{"query":..., "variables":...}` envelope, sends the body on standard input rather than in an argument, and turns a non-empty `errors` array into exit code `4` with the first message logged.
- [`__dybatpho_network_parse_authority`](#__dybatpho_network_parse_authority) — Split the authority of a URL into user, password, host, and port. The authority is the awkward part of the grammar: everything in it is optional, the delimiters repeat, and an IPv6 literal carries colons of its own inside brackets.
- [`__dybatpho_network_is_port`](#__dybatpho_network_is_port) — Return success when a value is a usable TCP or UDP port number.
- [`dybatpho::url_parse`](#dybatphourl_parse) — Split a URL into its components. The result lands in `DYBATPHO_URL`, one entry per component, the way `dybatpho::curl_parse_response` leaves a response in `DYBATPHO_HTTP_*`. Every entry is always present; a component the URL omits is empty, so a caller reads it without guarding against an unset key. A scheme and `://` are required. `mailto:someone@example.com` has neither an authority nor a host, and guessing what its parts are called would be inventing an answer rather than parsing one. The components are returned exactly as written. Percent-escapes are left alone, because decoding them here would destroy the difference between a separator and a character that merely looks like one; `dybatpho::url_decode` is there for the caller that wants it.
- [`dybatpho::url_part`](#dybatphourl_part) — Print one component of the last parsed URL.
- [`__dybatpho_network_ipv4_octets`](#__dybatpho_network_ipv4_octets) — Split an IPv4 address into its four octets as numbers. A leading zero is rejected rather than ignored. `inet_aton` and much of the software built on it read `010` as octal, so `127.0.0.010` is one host to one parser and another host to the next. An address that means two things is not an address this library will agree to.
- [`__dybatpho_network_ipv6_groups`](#__dybatpho_network_ipv6_groups) — Expand an IPv6 address into its eight groups as numbers. Everything an IPv6 address may leave out is put back here: the `::` that stands for a run of zero groups, and the dotted IPv4 tail that occupies the last two groups of a mapped address. Comparing addresses is only simple once both are written out in full. A zone index such as `%eth0` is rejected. It names an interface rather than a part of the address, and it is not comparable between two hosts.
- [`dybatpho::is_ipv4`](#dybatphois_ipv4) — Return success when a value is an IPv4 address.
- [`dybatpho::is_ipv6`](#dybatphois_ipv6) — Return success when a value is an IPv6 address.
- [`dybatpho::ip_version`](#dybatphoip_version) — Print which version of IP an address is.
- [`__dybatpho_network_parse_cidr`](#__dybatpho_network_parse_cidr) — Split a CIDR block into its address and prefix length.
- [`dybatpho::is_cidr`](#dybatphois_cidr) — Return success when a value is a CIDR block.
- [`dybatpho::cidr_netmask`](#dybatphocidr_netmask) — Print the dotted-decimal subnet mask of an IPv4 prefix length. There is no dotted form of an IPv6 prefix, so this is IPv4 only: the notation itself does not exist for the other version rather than being left out here.
- [`dybatpho::cidr_contains`](#dybatphocidr_contains) — Return success when an address falls inside a CIDR block. Both versions are supported, and an address is never inside a block of the other version: `::ffff:10.0.0.1` and `10.0.0.1` name the same host to some software, but they are not the same address and this does not pretend otherwise.
- [`dybatpho::port_open`](#dybatphoport_open) — Return success when a TCP port accepts a connection. The connection is made with Bash's own `/dev/tcp`, so nothing has to be installed for this to work. A build of Bash compiled without network redirections cannot do it, and reports the port as closed. The host and the port are passed to the timed-out shell as arguments rather than spliced into the script it runs, so a host name is never read as code.
- [`dybatpho::wait_port`](#dybatphowait_port) — Wait until a TCP port accepts a connection. This is the wait a script does after starting a service and before using it, written once. Each attempt is given no more time than the wait has left, so the whole call keeps to its budget rather than overrunning it by the length of one connection attempt.

## 💡 Tips

### `dybatpho::curl_do`

- The request body is written to the provided output file, or `/dev/null` when omitted

### `dybatpho::curl_download`

- The destination directory is created automatically before downloading

### `dybatpho::curl_upload`

- The request method defaults to `POST`; pass `--request PUT` (or similar) afterwards to override it

### `dybatpho::curl_resume_download`

- A partially downloaded destination file is resumed instead of restarted

### `dybatpho::curl_request`

- Response headers aren't captured while `DRY_RUN` is enabled

### `dybatpho::curl_timeout`

- Overrides apply only for the duration of this call; global `DYBATPHO_CURL_*` timeouts are unaffected

### `dybatpho::circuit_breaker`

- The command is executed with `eval`, so pass it as one shell command string

### `dybatpho::curl_paginate`

- An authenticated API takes its token through `DYBATPHO_CURL_SECRET_HEADERS`, which keeps it off `curl`'s command line for every page

## 📚 Reference

### `__dybatpho_network_config_escape`

Escape a value for a double-quoted `curl` config parameter.
  `curl` reads a config file as `name = "value"`, where the value takes
  backslash escapes, so a backslash or a quote inside a header has to be
  escaped or it ends the value early.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Raw value |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The escaped value, without its surrounding quotes


---

### `__dybatpho_network_secret_config`

Write the secret headers of the current request into a private
  config file for `curl --config`.


  The file is created under `umask 077` before anything is written to it, so
  the credential is never on disk in a mode another account could read, and it
  is removed as soon as the request is over. The path is an argument, which is
  public; the contents are not.

---

### `__dybatpho_network_rate_spec`

Parse a rate limit spec into a call budget and a window length.
  The spec is written the way a rate limit is spoken -- `10/60` is ten calls
  a minute -- and the window takes an optional unit so that `10/1m` and
  `5/500ms` mean what they look like.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Spec as `count/window`, where the window is in seconds unless it carries an `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h` suffix |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The count and the window in milliseconds, separated by a space

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The spec is not `count/window`, or asks for zero calls in no time


---

### `__dybatpho_network_rate_prune`

Drop the timestamps that have fallen out of a key's window, and
  report how many calls it has left.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Rate limit key |
| `$2` | number | Call budget per window |
| `$3` | number | Window length in milliseconds |
| `$4` | number | Current time in milliseconds |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_RATE_EVENTS`**: The key's remaining timestamps, oldest first
- **`__DYBATPHO_RATE_REMAINING`**: Remaining calls in the current window

**📝 Notes**

- The answer is also left in a variable, because a caller that read it through a command substitution would prune the window in a subshell and keep the unpruned one, growing the list forever and computing its waits from a timestamp that had already left the window

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Remaining calls in the current window


---

### `dybatpho::rate_limit_remaining`

Report how many calls a rate limit key has left in its window.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::rate_limit_remaining api.example.com 10/60

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Rate limit key |
| `$2` | string | Spec as `count/window` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Number of calls still allowed before the limiter waits

**🔗 See also**

- [dybatpho::rate_limit](#dybatphorate_limit)


---

### `dybatpho::rate_limit_reset`

Forget every call recorded against a rate limit key.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

### `dybatpho::rate_limit`

Run a command under a sliding window rate limit keyed by name.


  The limiter is the other half of `dybatpho::circuit_breaker`: the breaker
  stops calling a service that is already failing, and this stops calling one
  that is working faster than it agreed to be called. An API that answers
  `429` for the rest of the hour once a script has spent its budget is not
  made better by retrying -- it is made better by not spending the budget in
  the first place.


  A window holds the timestamps of the calls made inside it. While the budget
  has room the command runs immediately; when it is full the limiter waits
  exactly until the oldest call leaves the window, and then runs. Nothing is
  dropped, so a loop over five hundred items still finishes -- it finishes at
  the rate the spec allows.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::rate_limit api.example.com 10/60 -- dybatpho::curl_json https://api.example.com/v1/items /tmp/items.json
dybatpho::rate_limit api.example.com 10/60   # take a slot, run nothing

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Rate limit key, typically a host or service name |
| `$2` | string | Spec as `count/window`, where the window is in seconds unless it carries an `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h` suffix |
| `$@` | string | Command and arguments to run, optionally after a `--` separator |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT`** | bool | Wait for a free slot instead of refusing the call (default `true`) |
| **`DYBATPHO_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_WAIT`** | number | Longest wait in seconds the limiter will accept, `0` for no limit (default `0`) |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_RATE_EVENTS`**: The key's call timestamps

**📝 Notes**

- The command runs as an argument vector rather than through `eval`, unlike `dybatpho::circuit_breaker`; wrap a shell string in `bash -c` when one is really wanted
- The window is in-memory and process-local, like the circuit breaker's state; it does not persist across script invocations, nor out of a subshell

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The command succeeded, or no command was given and a slot was taken
- `9`: The budget is spent and the limiter was not allowed to wait for it; the command was not run
- `other`: The command's own exit code

### `dybatpho::curl_link`

Print the URL of one relation of the last response's `Link` header.


  A `Link` header is a comma-separated list of `<url>; rel="next"` entries,
  and one `rel` may name several relations at once, as in `rel="next last"`.
  A caller that matches `rel="next"` as a substring gets the first of those
  right and the second wrong.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::curl_request https://api.example.com/items /tmp/page.json
next="$(dybatpho::curl_link next)" || echo "that was the last page"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Relation name, such as `next`, `prev`, or `last` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_HTTP_HEADERS`** | map | Headers parsed by `dybatpho::curl_parse_response` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The URL carrying that relation

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The last response carried no `Link` header with that relation

---

### `dybatpho::curl_paginate`

Fetch every page of a paginated resource, following the `Link`
  header's `next` relation, and print each page's body to standard output.


  Paging is the part of an API client that gets written once per script and
  wrong once per script: the loop that misses the last page, the one that
  rebuilds `?page=N` by hand when the server already said where the next page
  is, the one that never stops because the server repeats itself. This
  follows what the server sent, stops when it stops offering a next page, and
  refuses to visit the same URL twice.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::curl_paginate "https://api.example.com/items?per_page=100" --header "Accept: application/json"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | URL of the first page |
| `$@` | string | Other options/arguments for curl, sent with every page |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_PAGINATE_MAX_PAGES`** | number | Most pages to fetch before stopping, `0` for no limit (default `100`) |
| **`DYBATPHO_PAGINATE_RATE`** | string | Optional rate limit spec, such as `10/60`, applied per page and keyed by host |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_HTTP_STATUS`**: The status of the last page fetched
- **`DYBATPHO_HTTP_HEADERS`**: The headers of the last page fetched

**📝 Notes**

- Under `DRY_RUN` only the first page is rehearsed, because no response comes back to say where the next one is

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The body of every page, in order

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: Every page was fetched
- `other`: The exit code of `dybatpho::curl_do` for the page that failed

### `dybatpho::curl_auth_bearer`

Make a request carrying a bearer token, without putting the token
  on `curl`'s command line.


  `--header "Authorization: Bearer ..."` publishes the token in
  `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, which every account on the host can read for as long
  as the request runs, and which `ps auxww` prints. The token goes through
  `DYBATPHO_CURL_SECRET_HEADERS` instead, which `dybatpho::curl_do` writes to
  a private config file and removes again afterwards.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::curl_auth_bearer https://api.example.com/v1/me "${API_TOKEN}" /tmp/me.json

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | URL |
| `$2` | string | Bearer token |
| `$3` | string | Location of curl output, default is `/dev/null` |
| `$@` | string | Other options/arguments for curl |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_HTTP_STATUS`**: The response status code
- **`DYBATPHO_HTTP_HEADERS`**: The response headers

**📝 Notes**

- Secret headers the caller already set are kept; the `Authorization` header is added to them

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The server answered with a 2xx status

- [dybatpho::curl_request](#dybatphocurl_request)


---

### `dybatpho::curl_graphql`

Post a GraphQL query and report the errors the response carries.


  A GraphQL endpoint answers `200 OK` and puts the failure in the body, so a
  script that only checks the status code reads "the field you asked for does
  not exist" as a successful request. This builds the `{"query":...,
  "variables":...}` envelope, sends the body on standard input rather than in
  an argument, and turns a non-empty `errors` array into exit code `4` with
  the first message logged.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::curl_graphql https://api.github.com/graphql \
  'query($owner:String!){ repositoryOwner(login:$owner){ login } }' \
  "$(dybatpho::json_object owner dynamotn)" /tmp/owner.json

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | GraphQL endpoint URL |
| `$2` | string | Query or mutation document |
| `$3` | string | Variables as a JSON object, default `{}` |
| `$4` | string | Location of curl output, default is `/dev/null` |
| `$@` | string | Other options/arguments for curl |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_GRAPHQL_TOKEN`** | string | Optional bearer token, sent out of band with the request |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_HTTP_STATUS`**: The response status code
- **`DYBATPHO_HTTP_HEADERS`**: The response headers

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The endpoint answered 2xx and the response carried no errors
- `4`: The endpoint answered 4xx, or answered with a non-empty `errors` array
- `5`: The endpoint answered 5xx

### `__dybatpho_network_parse_authority`

Split the authority of a URL into user, password, host, and port.
  The authority is the awkward part of the grammar: everything in it is
  optional, the delimiters repeat, and an IPv6 literal carries colons of its
  own inside brackets.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Authority, such as `user:pass@host:443` or `[::1]:8080` |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_URL`**: The `user`, `password`, `host`, and `port` entries

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The authority names no host, or a port that is not a port


---

### `__dybatpho_network_is_port`

Return success when a value is a usable TCP or UDP port number.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Value to test |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The value is a decimal number from 1 to 65535
- `1`: It is not


---

### `dybatpho::url_parse`

Split a URL into its components.
  The result lands in `DYBATPHO_URL`, one entry per component, the way
  `dybatpho::curl_parse_response` leaves a response in `DYBATPHO_HTTP_*`.
  Every entry is always present; a component the URL omits is empty, so a
  caller reads it without guarding against an unset key.


  A scheme and `://` are required. `mailto:someone@example.com` has neither an
  authority nor a host, and guessing what its parts are called would be
  inventing an answer rather than parsing one.


  The components are returned exactly as written. Percent-escapes are left
  alone, because decoding them here would destroy the difference between a
  separator and a character that merely looks like one; `dybatpho::url_decode`
  is there for the caller that wants it.

**🧪 Examples**

```bash
dybatpho::url_parse "https://user:secret@example.com:8443/a/b?q=1#top"
printf '%s\n' "${DYBATPHO_URL[host]}"    # example.com
printf '%s\n' "${DYBATPHO_URL[port]}"    # 8443
printf '%s\n' "${DYBATPHO_URL[path]}"    # /a/b

```

```bash
dybatpho::url_parse "http://[::1]:8080/health"
printf '%s\n' "${DYBATPHO_URL[host]}"    # ::1

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | URL to split |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_URL`**: map The `scheme`, `user`, `password`, `host`, `port`, `path`, `query`, and `fragment` of the URL

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The URL was split
- `1`: The URL has no scheme, no host, or a port that is not a port

**🔗 See also**

- [- `dybatpho::url_part` - `dybatpho::url_decode](#dybatphourl_part-dybatphourl_decode)


---

### `dybatpho::url_part`

Print one component of the last parsed URL.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::url_parse "https://example.com/health"
dybatpho::url_part host            # example.com
dybatpho::url_part port 443        # 443, the default, since none was given

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Component name: `scheme`, `user`, `password`, `host`, `port`, `path`, `query`, or `fragment` |
| `$2` | string | Optional value to print when the component is empty |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The component, or the default

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The component is empty and no default was supplied
- `1`: Stop the script when the name is not a component of a URL

---

### `__dybatpho_network_ipv4_octets`

Split an IPv4 address into its four octets as numbers.
  A leading zero is rejected rather than ignored. `inet_aton` and much of the
  software built on it read `010` as octal, so `127.0.0.010` is one host to
  one parser and another host to the next. An address that means two things
  is not an address this library will agree to.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Address to split |
| `$2` | string | Name of the array variable receiving the four octets |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`The`**: named array, to four numbers from 0 to 255

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The value is not an IPv4 address


---

### `__dybatpho_network_ipv6_groups`

Expand an IPv6 address into its eight groups as numbers.
  Everything an IPv6 address may leave out is put back here: the `::` that
  stands for a run of zero groups, and the dotted IPv4 tail that occupies the
  last two groups of a mapped address. Comparing addresses is only simple once
  both are written out in full.


  A zone index such as `%eth0` is rejected. It names an interface rather than
  a part of the address, and it is not comparable between two hosts.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Address to expand |
| `$2` | string | Name of the array variable receiving the eight groups |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`The`**: named array, to eight numbers from 0 to 65535

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The value is not an IPv6 address


---

### `dybatpho::is_ipv4`

Return success when a value is an IPv4 address.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::is_ipv4 192.0.2.10      # yes
dybatpho::is_ipv4 192.0.2.256     # no
dybatpho::is_ipv4 127.0.0.010     # no, a leading zero is ambiguous

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Value to test |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The value is an IPv4 address
- `1`: It is not


---

### `dybatpho::is_ipv6`

Return success when a value is an IPv6 address.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::is_ipv6 ::1                    # yes
dybatpho::is_ipv6 2001:db8::1            # yes
dybatpho::is_ipv6 ::ffff:192.0.2.1       # yes
dybatpho::is_ipv6 2001:db8::1::2         # no, one `::` is all there is

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Value to test |

**📝 Notes**

- A zone index such as `fe80::1%eth0` is refused: it names an interface rather than a part of the address

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The value is an IPv6 address
- `1`: It is not


---

### `dybatpho::ip_version`

Print which version of IP an address is.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::ip_version 192.0.2.10    # 4
dybatpho::ip_version ::1           # 6

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Address to inspect |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- `4` or `6`

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The value is not an IP address of either version


---

### `__dybatpho_network_parse_cidr`

Split a CIDR block into its address and prefix length.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Block such as `10.0.0.0/8` or `2001:db8::/32` |
| `$2` | string | Name of the variable receiving the address |
| `$3` | string | Name of the variable receiving the prefix length |
| `$4` | string | Name of the variable receiving the IP version |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`The`**: three named variables

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The value is not a CIDR block


---

### `dybatpho::is_cidr`

Return success when a value is a CIDR block.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::is_cidr 10.0.0.0/8        # yes
dybatpho::is_cidr 2001:db8::/32     # yes
dybatpho::is_cidr 10.0.0.0/33       # no

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Value to test |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The value is a CIDR block of either IP version
- `1`: It is not


---

### `dybatpho::cidr_netmask`

Print the dotted-decimal subnet mask of an IPv4 prefix length.
  There is no dotted form of an IPv6 prefix, so this is IPv4 only: the
  notation itself does not exist for the other version rather than being
  left out here.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::cidr_netmask 24    # 255.255.255.0
dybatpho::cidr_netmask 0     # 0.0.0.0

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Prefix length from 0 to 32, with or without a leading `/` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The subnet mask

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script when the value is not an IPv4 prefix length


---

### `dybatpho::cidr_contains`

Return success when an address falls inside a CIDR block.
  Both versions are supported, and an address is never inside a block of the
  other version: `::ffff:10.0.0.1` and `10.0.0.1` name the same host to some
  software, but they are not the same address and this does not pretend
  otherwise.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::cidr_contains 10.0.0.0/8 10.1.2.3            # yes
dybatpho::cidr_contains 10.0.0.0/8 11.1.2.3            # no
dybatpho::cidr_contains 2001:db8::/32 2001:db8::1      # yes
dybatpho::cidr_contains 0.0.0.0/0 203.0.113.1          # yes

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | CIDR block |
| `$2` | string | Address to test |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The address is inside the block
- `1`: It is not
- `1`: Stop the script when the block or the address is malformed


---

### `dybatpho::port_open`

Return success when a TCP port accepts a connection.
  The connection is made with Bash's own `/dev/tcp`, so nothing has to be
  installed for this to work. A build of Bash compiled without network
  redirections cannot do it, and reports the port as closed.


  The host and the port are passed to the timed-out shell as arguments rather
  than spliced into the script it runs, so a host name is never read as code.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::port_open localhost 5432
dybatpho::port_open db.internal 5432 2

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Host name or address |
| `$2` | number | Port |
| `$3` | number | Seconds to wait, defaulting to `DYBATPHO_PORT_TIMEOUT` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_PORT_TIMEOUT`** | number | Seconds to wait for the connection |

**📝 Notes**

- The timeout needs the `timeout` command; without it the connection waits as long as the system's own TCP timeout

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The port accepted a connection
- `1`: It did not, within the timeout
- `1`: Stop the script when the port or the timeout is not a number

**🔗 See also**

- [- `dybatpho::wait_port](#dybatphowait_port)


---

### `dybatpho::wait_port`

Wait until a TCP port accepts a connection.
  This is the wait a script does after starting a service and before using it,
  written once. Each attempt is given no more time than the wait has left, so
  the whole call keeps to its budget rather than overrunning it by the length
  of one connection attempt.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
docker compose up -d
dybatpho::wait_port localhost 5432 60 \
  || dybatpho::die "The database never came up"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Host name or address |
| `$2` | number | Port |
| `$3` | number | Seconds to keep trying, defaulting to `DYBATPHO_WAIT_PORT_TIMEOUT` |
| `$4` | number | Seconds between attempts, defaulting to `DYBATPHO_WAIT_PORT_INTERVAL` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_WAIT_PORT_TIMEOUT`** | number | Seconds to keep trying |
| **`DYBATPHO_WAIT_PORT_INTERVAL`** | number | Seconds between attempts |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The port accepted a connection before the time ran out
- `1`: It never did
- `1`: Stop the script when an argument is not a number
