## ✨ Overview

Configuration files are loaded in the order provided, so later files
override earlier files. Environment variables loaded with
`dybatpho::config_env` are applied last.


`dybatpho::config_profile` builds the usual two-file overlay on top of that
order: a base `config.yaml` followed by the `config.<profile>.yaml` beside
it, which may be absent. `dybatpho::config_load --optional` is the same
tolerance for any other list of files.


`dybatpho::config_set` changes a value in memory and
`dybatpho::config_save` writes chosen keys back to a file in the format
that file already uses: a dotenv rewrite keeps its comments, its blank
lines, and the order of its assignments, while JSON, YAML, and TOML are
rewritten through `jq` and `yq` so the rest of the document survives.


Keys can also be given a typed schema with `dybatpho::config_schema`.
`dybatpho::config_validate` then applies declared defaults, enforces
required keys, types, ranges, and enum choices, and reports every
violation together with the key that caused it. The same schema renders a
configuration reference through `dybatpho::config_doc`, and tells
`dybatpho::config_save` which values to write as numbers or booleans
rather than as strings.

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_config_set`](#__dybatpho_config_set) — 
- [`__dybatpho_config_load_dotenv`](#__dybatpho_config_load_dotenv) — 
- [`__dybatpho_config_load_structured`](#__dybatpho_config_load_structured) — 
- [`dybatpho::config_load`](#dybatphoconfig_load) — Load one or more configuration files, merging them left to right.
- [`dybatpho::config_profile`](#dybatphoconfig_profile) — Load a base configuration file and the profile overlay beside it. The overlay is the base name with the profile inserted before the extension, so `config.yaml` with profile `prod` reads `config.prod.yaml` after it. The base file is required; the overlay is not, which is what lets the same call work on a machine that has no profile-specific file.
- [`dybatpho::config_env`](#dybatphoconfig_env) — Load environment variables after an optional prefix.
- [`dybatpho::config_set`](#dybatphoconfig_set) — Set a configuration value in memory. The value joins the ones loaded from files and the environment, so a later `dybatpho::config_validate` checks it like any other, and `dybatpho::config_save` can write it back to a file.
- [`dybatpho::config_get`](#dybatphoconfig_get) — Print a configuration value.
- [`dybatpho::config_require`](#dybatphoconfig_require) — Require configuration keys to be present.
- [`dybatpho::config_export`](#dybatphoconfig_export) — Export loaded values as shell variables.
- [`__dybatpho_config_dotenv_value`](#__dybatpho_config_dotenv_value) — Render one value the way a dotenv file has to carry it. A value made only of characters the loader reads back verbatim is written bare; anything else is double-quoted, because that is the only form whose escapes the loader expands. The double quote itself is left alone on purpose: the loader strips the outer pair by position rather than by parsing, and `printf '%b'` has no `\"` escape to undo.
- [`__dybatpho_config_save_dotenv`](#__dybatpho_config_save_dotenv) — Rewrite the named keys into a dotenv file. Every line that assigns one of the keys is replaced in place, so comments, blank lines, unrelated assignments, and the order of the file all survive. Keys the file does not mention are appended in the order they were given.
- [`__dybatpho_config_save_structured`](#__dybatpho_config_save_structured) — Rewrite the named keys into a JSON, YAML, or TOML file. Each key is assigned on its own rather than merged from a second document, which is what keeps the file's own comments, indentation, and block style: a node imported from JSON carries its flow style with it and reflows everything around it. Values reach `jq` and `yq` through the environment, never through the command line, so a configured secret does not become world-readable in `/proc`. Only the declared schema makes a value a number or a boolean; without one it is written as a string.
- [`dybatpho::config_save`](#dybatphoconfig_save) — Write configuration values back to a file, in the format that file already uses. The extension selects the format, the file is created when it does not exist, and the rewrite is atomic, so a reader sees either the previous file or the complete new one. A dotenv file keeps its comments, blank lines, and assignment order; JSON, YAML, and TOML are rewritten with `jq` and `yq`, which leaves the keys this call does not name untouched. A value is written as a number or a boolean only when `dybatpho::config_schema` declared it as `int` or `bool`; otherwise it is written as a string.
- [`__dybatpho_config_schema_type`](#__dybatpho_config_schema_type) — Normalize a schema type name to its canonical form.
- [`__dybatpho_config_schema_clear`](#__dybatpho_config_schema_clear) — Drop every attribute previously declared for a key.
- [`__dybatpho_config_schema_attr`](#__dybatpho_config_schema_attr) — Print a schema attribute, or a fallback when it is not declared.
- [`__dybatpho_config_schema_constraints`](#__dybatpho_config_schema_constraints) — Describe the range and choice constraints declared for a key.
- [`dybatpho::config_schema`](#dybatphoconfig_schema) — Declare validation rules for a configuration key.
- [`dybatpho::config_schema_reset`](#dybatphoconfig_schema_reset) — Forget every declared configuration schema.
- [`__dybatpho_config_schema_error`](#__dybatpho_config_schema_error) — Record a validation failure for a configuration key.
- [`__dybatpho_config_schema_check`](#__dybatpho_config_schema_check) — Validate a single value against the type declared for its key.
- [`dybatpho::config_validate`](#dybatphoconfig_validate) — Validate configured values against all declared schemas. Missing optional keys take their declared default, and every violation is reported with the key that caused it.
- [`__dybatpho_config_doc_cell`](#__dybatpho_config_doc_cell) — Render one Markdown table cell, escaping pipes and marking empties.
- [`__dybatpho_config_doc_json_value`](#__dybatpho_config_doc_json_value) — Render one JSON value, emitting `null` for an undeclared attribute.
- [`dybatpho::config_doc`](#dybatphoconfig_doc) — Render documentation for every declared configuration key.

## 💡 Tips

### `dybatpho::config_load`

- Pass `--` before a file whose own name starts with `--`.

### `dybatpho::config_env`

- Environment variables override values loaded from configuration files.

### `dybatpho::config_save`

- Name the keys explicitly when `dybatpho::config_env` was used, so an unrelated environment variable is not persisted along with them.

### `dybatpho::config_schema`

- Call `dybatpho::config_validate` after all files and environment overlays are loaded.
- Declaring the same key twice replaces its previous rules instead of merging them.

### `dybatpho::config_doc`

- Pipe the Markdown output into a `CONFIGURATION.md` file to keep docs in sync with the schema.

---

### `__dybatpho_config_load_dotenv`



---

### `__dybatpho_config_load_structured`



---

### `dybatpho::config_load`

Load one or more configuration files, merging them left to right.

**🧪 Examples**

```bash
dybatpho::config_load defaults.yaml production.yaml

```

```bash
# A machine-local override that may simply not be there.
dybatpho::config_load --optional /etc/app.env "${HOME}/.config/app.env"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional `--optional`, to skip files that do not exist instead of failing |
| `$@` | string | Files in dotenv, JSON, YAML, or TOML format, in increasing precedence order |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_CONFIG`**: Merged values, where a later file replaces an earlier one

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: A required file is missing, or a file has an unsupported format or invalid configuration


---

### `dybatpho::config_profile`

Load a base configuration file and the profile overlay beside it.
  The overlay is the base name with the profile inserted before the
  extension, so `config.yaml` with profile `prod` reads `config.prod.yaml`
  after it. The base file is required; the overlay is not, which is what lets
  the same call work on a machine that has no profile-specific file.

**🧪 Examples**

```bash
dybatpho::config_profile ./config.yaml prod

```

```bash
# The profile comes from the environment when it is not passed.
DYBATPHO_CONFIG_PROFILE=staging dybatpho::config_profile ./config.json

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Base configuration file, whose extension selects the format |
| `$2` | string | Profile name, defaulting to `DYBATPHO_CONFIG_PROFILE` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_CONFIG_PROFILE`** | string | Profile used when none is passed |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_CONFIG`**: Base values, overlaid by the profile file when it exists

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: No profile is given, the profile name is invalid, or the base file is missing or unreadable


---

### `dybatpho::config_env`

Load environment variables after an optional prefix.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional prefix, such as `APP_` |


---

### `dybatpho::config_set`

Set a configuration value in memory.
  The value joins the ones loaded from files and the environment, so a later
  `dybatpho::config_validate` checks it like any other, and
  `dybatpho::config_save` can write it back to a file.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::config_set PORT 9090
dybatpho::config_save ./config.yaml PORT

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Configuration key |
| `$2` | string | Value |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_CONFIG`**: The key is added or replaced

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The key is invalid


---

### `dybatpho::config_get`

Print a configuration value.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Configuration key |
| `$2` | string | Optional default value |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Configuration value

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Key is missing and no default was supplied


---

### `dybatpho::config_require`

Require configuration keys to be present.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$@` | string | Configuration keys |

Export loaded values as shell variables.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional prefix for exported variable names |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: A key cannot be represented as a shell variable


---

### `__dybatpho_config_dotenv_value`

Render one value the way a dotenv file has to carry it.
  A value made only of characters the loader reads back verbatim is written
  bare; anything else is double-quoted, because that is the only form whose
  escapes the loader expands. The double quote itself is left alone on
  purpose: the loader strips the outer pair by position rather than by
  parsing, and `printf '%b'` has no `\"` escape to undo.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Value |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The value, bare or double-quoted


---

### `__dybatpho_config_save_dotenv`

Rewrite the named keys into a dotenv file.
  Every line that assigns one of the keys is replaced in place, so comments,
  blank lines, unrelated assignments, and the order of the file all survive.
  Keys the file does not mention are appended in the order they were given.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Destination file, which is created when it does not exist |
| `$@` | string | Configuration keys to write |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: A key cannot be spelled as a dotenv name, or the write fails


---

### `__dybatpho_config_save_structured`

Rewrite the named keys into a JSON, YAML, or TOML file.
  Each key is assigned on its own rather than merged from a second document,
  which is what keeps the file's own comments, indentation, and block style:
  a node imported from JSON carries its flow style with it and reflows
  everything around it.


  Values reach `jq` and `yq` through the environment, never through the
  command line, so a configured secret does not become world-readable in
  `/proc`. Only the declared schema makes a value a number or a boolean;
  without one it is written as a string.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Format: `json`, `yaml`, or `toml` |
| `$2` | string | Destination file, which is created when it does not exist |
| `$@` | string | Configuration keys to write |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: `jq` or `yq` is missing, the file cannot be parsed, or the write fails


---

### `dybatpho::config_save`

Write configuration values back to a file, in the format that
  file already uses. The extension selects the format, the file is created
  when it does not exist, and the rewrite is atomic, so a reader sees either
  the previous file or the complete new one.


  A dotenv file keeps its comments, blank lines, and assignment order; JSON,
  YAML, and TOML are rewritten with `jq` and `yq`, which leaves the keys this
  call does not name untouched. A value is written as a number or a boolean
  only when `dybatpho::config_schema` declared it as `int` or `bool`;
  otherwise it is written as a string.

**🧪 Examples**

```bash
dybatpho::config_set PORT 9090
dybatpho::config_save ./config.yaml PORT

```

```bash
# Persist everything that is currently loaded.
dybatpho::config_save "${HOME}/.config/app.env"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Destination file in dotenv, JSON, YAML, or TOML format |
| `$@` | string | Configuration keys to write, defaulting to every loaded key in name order |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
