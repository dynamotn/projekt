## ✨ Overview

Wrappers that make irreversible operations explicit before they run:


- removing files and directories (`dybatpho::safe_rm`)
- overwriting existing files, including copy and move
  (`dybatpho::safe_overwrite`, `dybatpho::safe_copy`, `dybatpho::safe_move`)
- extracting archives, with path-traversal validation
  (`dybatpho::safe_extract`)
- changing system state through an external command
  (`dybatpho::safe_system`)


Every wrapper applies the same three rules:


1. the target path is validated against protected paths and, when
   `DYBATPHO_SAFE_ROOTS` is set, confined inside those roots;
2. the operation runs unattended only with `--force` (or `DYBATPHO_FORCE`),
   otherwise it asks for confirmation on an interactive terminal;
3. a non-interactive run without `--force` refuses instead of guessing, and
   `DRY_RUN` prints the command instead of executing it.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORCE`** | bool | Set to `true` to approve every guarded operation without prompting |
| **`DYBATPHO_INTERACTIVE`** | string | `auto` detects a terminal on stdin, `true`/`false` override the detection |
| **`DYBATPHO_SAFE_ROOTS`** | string | Colon-separated roots; when set, guarded paths must stay inside one of them |
| **`DYBATPHO_PROTECTED_PATHS`** | string | Extra colon-separated paths that guarded operations must never touch |

## 🚀 Usage

### Remove a build directory, asking first


```bash
dybatpho::safe_rm --recursive "${build_dir}"
```


### Overwrite a config file unattended, keeping a backup


```bash
dybatpho::safe_overwrite --force --backup "${config}" \
  && printf '%s\n' "${rendered}" > "${config}"
```


### Extract an untrusted archive


```bash
dybatpho::safe_extract --force "${tarball}" "${workdir}" 1
```


### Guard a system change


```bash
dybatpho::safe_system "Restart nginx" -- systemctl restart nginx
```

## 💡 Tips

- Confine a whole script with `DYBATPHO_SAFE_ROOTS="${workdir}"` so a bad path can never reach the rest of the filesystem.

### `dybatpho::safe_rm`

- Missing paths are skipped instead of failing, like `rm -f`

### `dybatpho::safe_overwrite`

- Call it as a guard: `dybatpho::safe_overwrite "${file}" && printf '%s' "${data}" > "${file}"`

### `dybatpho::safe_extract`

- Symlink targets stored inside an archive aren't inspected; extract untrusted archives into a scratch directory
