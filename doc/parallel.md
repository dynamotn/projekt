## ✨ Overview

This module runs a list of jobs several at a time and reports what each one
did. It exists because the hand-written version of this loop gets three
things wrong: it launches every job at once and overwhelms the machine, it
lets concurrent jobs interleave their output into an unreadable mess, and it
loses the exit code of everything except the last job.


Each job's output is captured while it runs and replayed afterwards in the
order the jobs were submitted, so the result reads as though the jobs had
run one after another. Each job's exit code is recorded separately, and the
run as a whole fails when any job failed.


A job runs in a subshell of the calling shell, so it can call any function
the caller has defined without exporting anything.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_JOBS`** | number | Default number of jobs to run at once, default is the CPU count |
| **`DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_FAILFAST`** | string | When true-like, stop launching and end running jobs once one fails |
| **`DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_STATUS`** | array | Exit code of each job of the last run, in submission order |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_parallel_jobs`](#__dybatpho_parallel_jobs) — Resolve how many jobs to run at once. The count is returned through a variable rather than printed, because a command substitution would validate inside a subshell, where a rejected count could not stop the caller from running the jobs anyway.
- [`__dybatpho_parallel_terminate`](#__dybatpho_parallel_terminate) — End every job still running in the pool. A job is a subshell that usually has children of its own, and ending the subshell alone would orphan them. The pool runs with job control on, which puts each job in its own process group, so the whole group can be ended at once.
- [`__dybatpho_parallel_flush`](#__dybatpho_parallel_flush) — Replay each job's captured output, in submission order.
- [`__dybatpho_parallel_any_failed`](#__dybatpho_parallel_any_failed) — Return success when a finished job has failed.
- [`__dybatpho_parallel_prune`](#__dybatpho_parallel_prune) — Drop the process IDs that have already been reaped. `wait -n` reaps one child, so at least one entry disappears on every pass and the pool always makes progress.
- [`__dybatpho_parallel_pool`](#__dybatpho_parallel_pool) — Run a bounded pool over jobs started by a launcher function. The launcher receives a job index and the capture directory, and starts that one job. The pool waits with `wait -n`, so a finished job is replaced right away rather than at the end of a batch. Exit codes travel through files rather than through `wait`, because `wait -n` reports a status without saying which job it belongs to.
- [`__dybatpho_parallel_wait_all`](#__dybatpho_parallel_wait_all) — Wait for every job the pool still tracks.
- [`dybatpho::parallel_map`](#dybatphoparallel_map) — Run one command once per item, several items at a time. The command and each item are passed as separate arguments, so an item containing a space or a quote is handled as one value rather than re-parsed as shell syntax.
- [`__dybatpho_parallel_launch_item`](#__dybatpho_parallel_launch_item) — Start one item's job, capturing its output and exit code.
- [`dybatpho::parallel_run`](#dybatphoparallel_run) — Run several shell commands at once, each given as one string. Use this when the jobs differ from one another; use `dybatpho::parallel_map` when the same command runs over a list, because that form needs no quoting.
- [`__dybatpho_parallel_launch_command`](#__dybatpho_parallel_launch_command) — Start one command's job, capturing its output and exit code.
- [`dybatpho::parallel_status`](#dybatphoparallel_status) — Print the exit code of one job of the last run.
- [`dybatpho::parallel_count`](#dybatphoparallel_count) — Print how many jobs the last run had.
- [`dybatpho::parallel_failed`](#dybatphoparallel_failed) — Print how many jobs of the last run failed. A job that fail-fast prevented from starting is not counted: it did not run, so it did not fail.

## 💡 Tips

### `dybatpho::parallel_map`

- A function defined by the caller works as the command, because each job runs in a subshell of the calling shell
- The per-job exit codes are kept in the calling shell, so a call made inside `$(...)` or a pipeline reports its own output but leaves `dybatpho::parallel_status` unchanged

### `dybatpho::parallel_run`

- Each string is evaluated as a shell command, so quote anything inside it that must survive that second round of parsing
- The per-job exit codes are kept in the calling shell, so a call made inside `$(...)` or a pipeline reports its own output but leaves `dybatpho::parallel_status` unchanged

## 📚 Reference

### `__dybatpho_parallel_jobs`

Resolve how many jobs to run at once.
  The count is returned through a variable rather than printed, because a
  command substitution would validate inside a subshell, where a rejected
  count could not stop the caller from running the jobs anyway.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Name of the variable that receives the count |
| `$2` | string | Requested count, or empty/`0` to decide automatically |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`The`**: named variable, to a positive job count

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The requested count is not a positive integer


---

### `__dybatpho_parallel_terminate`

End every job still running in the pool.
  A job is a subshell that usually has children of its own, and ending the
  subshell alone would orphan them. The pool runs with job control on, which
  puts each job in its own process group, so the whole group can be ended at
  once.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$@` | number | Process IDs to end, each the leader of its job's process group |


---

### `__dybatpho_parallel_flush`

Replay each job's captured output, in submission order.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Directory holding the captured output |
| `$2` | number | Number of jobs |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Standard output of every job, in order

**📤 Output on stderr**

- Standard error of every job, in order


---

### `__dybatpho_parallel_any_failed`

Return success when a finished job has failed.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Directory holding the captured output |
| `$2` | number | Number of jobs |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: A finished job failed
- `1`: Every job that finished so far succeeded


---

### `__dybatpho_parallel_prune`

Drop the process IDs that have already been reaped.
  `wait -n` reaps one child, so at least one entry disappears on every pass
  and the pool always makes progress.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Name of the array holding the process IDs |


---

### `__dybatpho_parallel_pool`

Run a bounded pool over jobs started by a launcher function.
  The launcher receives a job index and the capture directory, and starts that
  one job. The pool waits with `wait -n`, so a finished job is replaced right
  away rather than at the end of a batch. Exit codes travel through files
  rather than through `wait`, because `wait -n` reports a status without
  saying which job it belongs to.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | number | Jobs to run at once |
| `$2` | string | Launcher function name |
| `$3` | number | Number of jobs |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_STATUS

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: Every job that ran succeeded
- `1`: At least one job failed


---

### `__dybatpho_parallel_wait_all`

Wait for every job the pool still tracks.

_Function has no arguments._


---

### `dybatpho::parallel_map`

Run one command once per item, several items at a time.
  The command and each item are passed as separate arguments, so an item
  containing a space or a quote is handled as one value rather than re-parsed
  as shell syntax.

**🧪 Examples**

```bash
function _convert { dybatpho::info "converting $1"; convert "$1" "${1%.png}.webp"; }
dybatpho::parallel_map 4 _convert ./images/*.png

```

```bash
# Let the job count follow the machine.
dybatpho::parallel_map 0 _check "${hosts[@]}"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | number | Jobs to run at once, or `0` to use the CPU count |
| `$2` | string | Command or function to run for each item |
| `$@` | string | Items, one job each |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_JOBS`** | number | Job count used when `0` is requested |
| **`DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_FAILFAST`** | string | When true-like, stop at the first failure |
| **`DRY_RUN`** | string | When true-like, report the jobs instead of running them |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_STATUS

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Standard output of every job, replayed in submission order

**📤 Output on stderr**

- Standard error of every job, replayed in submission order

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: Every job succeeded
- `1`: At least one job failed


---

### `__dybatpho_parallel_launch_item`

Start one item's job, capturing its output and exit code.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | number | Job index |
| `$2` | string | Capture directory |


---

### `dybatpho::parallel_run`

Run several shell commands at once, each given as one string.
  Use this when the jobs differ from one another; use `dybatpho::parallel_map`
  when the same command runs over a list, because that form needs no quoting.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::parallel_run 3 \
  "npm run build" \
  "cargo build --release" \
  "go build ./..."

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | number | Jobs to run at once, or `0` to use the CPU count |
| `$@` | string | Shell command strings, one job each |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_FAILFAST`** | string | When true-like, stop at the first failure |
| **`DRY_RUN`** | string | When true-like, report the commands instead of running them |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- DYBATPHO_PARALLEL_STATUS

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Standard output of every job, replayed in submission order

**📤 Output on stderr**

- Standard error of every job, replayed in submission order

dybatpho::parallel_map 4 _check "${hosts[@]}" || true
for index in $(seq 0 $(($(dybatpho::parallel_count) - 1))); do
  dybatpho::print "${hosts[index]} -> $(dybatpho::parallel_status "${index}")"
done

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | number | Job index, counting from zero in submission order |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The job's exit code, or `skipped` when fail-fast stopped it from running

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: There is no job with that index


---

### `dybatpho::parallel_count`

Print how many jobs the last run had.

_Function has no arguments._

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Job count


---

### `dybatpho::parallel_failed`

Print how many jobs of the last run failed.
  A job that fail-fast prevented from starting is not counted: it did not run,
  so it did not fail.

_Function has no arguments._

**📤 Output on stdout**
