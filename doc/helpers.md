## ✨ Overview

`src/helpers.sh` groups together the small building blocks that many other
modules rely on:


- validating function arguments
- checking environment and tool dependencies
- testing common conditions
- checking several commands or env vars at once
- choosing the first usable value from fallbacks
- assigning default env values
- retrying flaky commands
- opening an interactive breakpoint
- asking the library about itself


That last one is `dybatpho::provides`, `dybatpho::describe` and
`dybatpho::function_list`. The library documents itself in `doc/`, which
answers the question while you are reading; these answer it from the
running shell, where the question actually comes up. They ask Bash rather
than the filesystem: `declare -F` under `extdebug` reports the file and line
a function was defined at, and the documentation comment is sitting just
above that line in the source that was loaded. They live here, in a core
module, because a helper you have to remember to load is one you will not
reach for at a prompt.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_RETRY_BASE_DELAY`** | number | First retry delay in seconds (default `2`) |
| **`DYBATPHO_RETRY_MAX_DELAY`** | number | Longest a single retry waits (default `30`) |
| **`DYBATPHO_RETRY_JITTER`** | bool | Add up to one base delay of random jitter (default `false`) |
| **`DYBATPHO_REPL_HISTORY_FILE`** | string | History file used by `dybatpho::breakpoint` |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`dybatpho::expect_args`](#dybatphoexpect_args) — Validate function arguments and assign them into named local variables.
- [`dybatpho::still_has_args`](#dybatphostill_has_args) — Check whether at least one more positional argument remains after the current one. This helper is useful while manually parsing a shifting argument list.
- [`dybatpho::expect_envs`](#dybatphoexpect_envs) — Ensure that required environment variables are set.
- [`dybatpho::require`](#dybatphorequire) — Ensure that a required command is installed, and new enough. With a version range, the command is asked what version it is through `dybatpho::command_version`, the answer is normalized by `dybatpho::semver_coerce`, and the result is matched with `dybatpho::semver_satisfies`. The range is written the way that function documents it: `>=1.6`, `^4`, `>=1.2 <2`, `1.2.x`, or alternatives with `||`. The range has to open with one of `>`, `<`, `=`, `^`, or `~`. A bare `4` is a valid range on its own elsewhere, but this argument has meant an exit code since before ranges existed here, and no amount of cleverness makes `require jq 3` mean both things at once. Matching a version needs the optional `semver` module. Rather than let a range pass unchecked in a script that did not load it, this stops with a message naming what to load: a requirement that is silently not enforced is worse than one that was never written. A command whose version cannot be read is also a failure, for the same reason. `dybatpho::doctor` treats that case as a report rather than a failure, because a report is allowed to say "I could not tell".
- [`dybatpho::command_exists_all`](#dybatphocommand_exists_all) — Return success when all listed commands are available.
- [`dybatpho::is`](#dybatphois) — Check whether a value matches a supported shell-oriented condition.
- [`dybatpho::coalesce`](#dybatphocoalesce) — Print the first non-empty value from a list of fallbacks.
- [`dybatpho::coalesce_cmd`](#dybatphocoalesce_cmd) — Print the first available command from a list of candidates.
- [`dybatpho::default_env`](#dybatphodefault_env) — Assign and export a default value for an environment variable when it is empty.
- [`dybatpho::require_envs_any`](#dybatphorequire_envs_any) — Ensure that at least one of the listed environment variables is set.
- [`dybatpho::assert`](#dybatphoassert) — Evaluate a shell condition string and stop with a message when it fails.
- [`__dybatpho_helpers_backoff`](#__dybatpho_helpers_backoff) — Compute how long the nth retry waits. Exponential from a base delay, capped, with optional jitter — the policy the HTTP retries in `network.sh` already used, which the generic retry here did not. Jitter matters when several machines retry the same failing dependency: without it they all come back at the same instant, which is the load that kept it down.
- [`dybatpho::retry`](#dybatphoretry) — Retry a shell command with escalating delays until it succeeds or retries are exhausted.
- [`dybatpho::retry_until`](#dybatphoretry_until) — Retry a shell command until it succeeds or the retry budget is exhausted, using a fixed delay.
- [`dybatpho::breakpoint`](#dybatphobreakpoint) — Open an interactive breakpoint for debugging a running script.
- [`__dybatpho_helpers_locate`](#__dybatpho_helpers_locate) — Print the file and line a function was defined at. `declare -F` names the file only while `extdebug` is on, and that option also changes how `DEBUG` and `RETURN` traps behave, so it is switched on for the one call and put back exactly as it was found. `shopt -p` reports a non-zero status when the option is off, which under `errexit` would end the caller before anything was looked up.
- [`__dybatpho_helpers_qualify`](#__dybatpho_helpers_qualify) — Print a function name with the `dybatpho::` prefix it may have been given without.
- [`__dybatpho_helpers_module_of`](#__dybatpho_helpers_module_of) — Print the module a loaded source file belongs to. A module is recognised by its place rather than its name: a file directly inside a `src` directory is that module, and the bootstrap is `init`. Anything else is refused, because a bundle holds every module in one file and answering with that file's name would attribute every function in the library to a module called `dybatpho.bundle`.
- [`dybatpho::provides`](#dybatphoprovides) — Print the module that defines a function. The answer comes from where Bash says the function was defined, so it describes the code that is actually loaded rather than what a directory listing suggests. Functions the bootstrap defines report `init`.
- [`dybatpho::describe`](#dybatphodescribe) — Print the documentation comment of a function. The library documents itself in `doc/`, which answers the question when you are reading it. At a prompt, mid-script, the question is what a function takes and what it returns, and the answer is in a browser tab. This reads it out of the source the shell actually loaded, so it describes the code that will run, and it is there whether or not `doc/` was ever generated. The banner rules and any `shellcheck` directive between the comment and the function are dropped, one `#` and the space after it are taken off each line, and the `@description` marker is removed from the prose it introduces. Everything else, `@arg` and `@exitcode` tags included, is printed as the source wrote it.
- [`dybatpho::function_list`](#dybatphofunction_list) — Print the public functions this shell has loaded. Without an argument this is the whole loaded API; with one it is what a single module exports, which is the list to skim when reaching for a module for the first time. Only `dybatpho::` names are listed. The `__dybatpho_` helpers are internal, and `declare -F` is right there for anyone debugging one.

## 🚀 Usage

### When to use this module


Use `helpers.sh` when you want to:


- make shell functions fail fast on bad input
- avoid repeating `command -v`, `[[ -f ... ]]`, `[[ -d ... ]]`, and similar checks
- validate that any or all required commands and env vars are present
- choose the first non-empty value from environment, defaults, or arguments
- assign fallback defaults into environment variables
- retry transient commands without rewriting loop logic
- inspect runtime state interactively while debugging a script


### Common patterns


#### Validate function input


```bash
function copy_file() {
  local src dst
  dybatpho::expect_args src dst -- "$@"
  cp "${src}" "${dst}"
}
```


#### Require environment + binary before running


```bash
dybatpho::expect_envs API_TOKEN
dybatpho::require curl
```


#### Guard conditions


```bash
if ! dybatpho::is file "${config_path}"; then
  dybatpho::die "Config file not found: ${config_path}"
fi
```


#### Retry transient network operations


```bash
dybatpho::retry 4 "curl -fsSL '${health_url}'" "service health check"
```


#### Pick the first configured value


```bash
api_host="$(dybatpho::coalesce "${API_HOST:-}" "${FALLBACK_HOST:-}" "http://localhost:8080")"
```


#### Pick the first available command


```bash
json_tool="$(dybatpho::coalesce_cmd jq yq python3)"
```


#### Add an optional breakpoint


```bash
dybatpho::is true "${DEBUG_BREAK:-false}" && dybatpho::breakpoint
```

## 💡 Tips

- Combine `dybatpho::expect_envs` and `dybatpho::require` near the top of entrypoint scripts to fail fast on missing configuration or dependencies.

### `dybatpho::expect_args`

- Prefer calling this at the top of reusable functions instead of manually unpacking `$@`

### `dybatpho::require`

- Prefer this over repeating inline `command -v ... || exit` checks throughout a script

### `dybatpho::is`

- Use this helper to keep calling code readable instead of scattering shell test syntax across the script

### `dybatpho::assert`

- The assertion command is executed with `eval`

### `dybatpho::retry`

- The command is executed with `eval`, so pass it as one shell command string
- Turn on `DYBATPHO_RETRY_JITTER` when several machines retry the same dependency, so they do not all come back at the same instant
- Pass a short description when the raw command is noisy so retry logs stay readable

### `dybatpho::retry_until`

- The command is executed with `eval`, so pass it as one shell command string

### `dybatpho::breakpoint`

- This helper is intended for interactive local debugging, not unattended CI or production runs

## 📚 Reference

### `dybatpho::expect_args`

Validate function arguments and assign them into named local variables.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
local arg1 arg2 .. argN
dybatpho::expect_args arg1 arg2 .. argN -- "$@"

```

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script if the specification is invalid or required arguments are missing
- `0`: Assign arguments to the requested variable names and return successfully


---

### `dybatpho::still_has_args`

Check whether at least one more positional argument remains after the current one.
This helper is useful while manually parsing a shifting argument list.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
while dybatpho::still_has_args "$@" && shift; do
  echo "Function has next argument is $1"
done
```

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: Still has an argument
- `1`: No additional arguments remain


---

### `dybatpho::expect_envs`

Ensure that required environment variables are set.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::expect_envs ENV_VAR1 ENV_VAR2
```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$@` | string | Environment variables to check |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script if any variable is unset or empty


---

### `dybatpho::require`

Ensure that a required command is installed, and new enough.
  With a version range, the command is asked what version it is through
  `dybatpho::command_version`, the answer is normalized by
  `dybatpho::semver_coerce`, and the result is matched with
  `dybatpho::semver_satisfies`. The range is written the way that function
  documents it: `>=1.6`, `^4`, `>=1.2 <2`, `1.2.x`, or alternatives with `||`.


  The range has to open with one of `>`, `<`, `=`, `^`, or `~`. A bare `4`
  is a valid range on its own elsewhere, but this argument has meant an exit
  code since before ranges existed here, and no amount of cleverness makes
  `require jq 3` mean both things at once.


  Matching a version needs the optional `semver` module. Rather than let a
  range pass unchecked in a script that did not load it, this stops with a
  message naming what to load: a requirement that is silently not enforced is
  worse than one that was never written.


  A command whose version cannot be read is also a failure, for the same
  reason. `dybatpho::doctor` treats that case as a report rather than a
  failure, because a report is allowed to say "I could not tell".

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::require git
dybatpho::require jq '>=1.6'
dybatpho::require yq '^4' 3

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Command that must be available |
| `$2` | string | Version range opening with an operator, or the exit code |
| `$3` | number | Exit code when a range was given (default 127) |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `127`: Stop script if command isn't installed, or is outside the range
- `0`: The command is available and satisfies the range
- `other`: Exit code given as an argument, instead of 127

---

### `__dybatpho_helpers_backoff`

Compute how long the nth retry waits.
  Exponential from a base delay, capped, with optional jitter — the policy the
  HTTP retries in `network.sh` already used, which the generic retry here did
  not. Jitter matters when several machines retry the same failing dependency:
  without it they all come back at the same instant, which is the load that
  kept it down.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | number | Attempt number, counting from 1 |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Delay in seconds

| `$2` | number | Delay in seconds between attempts |
| `$3` | string | Shell command string to run |
| `$4` | string | Optional short description for retry logs |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The command eventually succeeds
- `1`: The command never succeeds and returns its final exit code


---

### `dybatpho::breakpoint`

Open an interactive breakpoint for debugging a running script.

_Function has no arguments._

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_REPL_HISTORY_FILE`** | string | Override where REPL history is persisted between breakpoint sessions |


---

### `__dybatpho_helpers_locate`

Print the file and line a function was defined at.
  `declare -F` names the file only while `extdebug` is on, and that option
  also changes how `DEBUG` and `RETURN` traps behave, so it is switched on for
  the one call and put back exactly as it was found. `shopt -p` reports a
  non-zero status when the option is off, which under `errexit` would end the
  caller before anything was looked up.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Function name, in full |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Two lines: the file, then the line number

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: No such function, or Bash could not say where it came from


---

### `__dybatpho_helpers_qualify`

Print a function name with the `dybatpho::` prefix it may have
  been given without.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Function name, with or without a prefix |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The full function name


---

### `__dybatpho_helpers_module_of`

Print the module a loaded source file belongs to.
  A module is recognised by its place rather than its name: a file directly
  inside a `src` directory is that module, and the bootstrap is `init`.
  Anything else is refused, because a bundle holds every module in one file
  and answering with that file's name would attribute every function in the
  library to a module called `dybatpho.bundle`.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Path of a file the library was loaded from |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The module name

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The file is not a module source


---

### `dybatpho::provides`

Print the module that defines a function.
  The answer comes from where Bash says the function was defined, so it
  describes the code that is actually loaded rather than what a directory
  listing suggests. Functions the bootstrap defines report `init`.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::provides semver_valid            # semver
dybatpho::provides dybatpho::cache_run     # cache
dybatpho::provides --path cache_run        # /path/to/src/cache.sh:245

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | `--path` to print `file:line` instead of the module name |
| `$@` | string | Function name, with or without the `dybatpho::` prefix |

**📝 Notes**

- A bundle holds every module in one file, so only `--path` can answer there, and it still points at the right line

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The module name, or `file:line` with `--path`

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The function is not defined in this shell, or it came from a bundle, where there are no module sources to name

**🔗 See also**

- [- `dybatpho::describe` - `dybatpho::function_list](#dybatphodescribe-dybatphofunction_list)


---

### `dybatpho::describe`

Print the documentation comment of a function.
  The library documents itself in `doc/`, which answers the question when you
  are reading it. At a prompt, mid-script, the question is what a function
  takes and what it returns, and the answer is in a browser tab. This reads it
  out of the source the shell actually loaded, so it describes the code that
  will run, and it is there whether or not `doc/` was ever generated.


  The banner rules and any `shellcheck` directive between the comment and the
  function are dropped, one `#` and the space after it are taken off each
  line, and the `@description` marker is removed from the prose it introduces.
  Everything else, `@arg` and `@exitcode` tags included, is printed as the
  source wrote it.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::describe cache_run
dybatpho::describe dybatpho::semver_satisfies

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Function name, with or without the `dybatpho::` prefix |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- A heading naming the function and where it came from, then the comment

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The function is not defined in this shell, or its source is no longer readable

**🔗 See also**

- [- `dybatpho::provides](#dybatphoprovides)


---

### `dybatpho::function_list`

Print the public functions this shell has loaded.
  Without an argument this is the whole loaded API; with one it is what a
  single module exports, which is the list to skim when reaching for a module
  for the first time.


  Only `dybatpho::` names are listed. The `__dybatpho_` helpers are internal,
  and `declare -F` is right there for anyone debugging one.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::function_list              # everything loaded
dybatpho::function_list cache        # just that module
dybatpho::function_list | wc -l

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional module name to limit the list to |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- One function name per line, in alphabetical order

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script when the named module is not loaded, or when the library came from a bundle, where no function can be attributed to a module

**🔗 See also**

- [- `dybatpho::module_list` - `dybatpho::provides](#dybatphomodule_list-dybatphoprovides)
