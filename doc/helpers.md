## ✨ Overview

`src/helpers.sh` groups together the small building blocks that many other
modules rely on:


- validating function arguments
- checking environment and tool dependencies
- testing common conditions
- checking several commands or env vars at once
- choosing the first usable value from fallbacks
- assigning default env values
- retrying flaky commands
- opening an interactive breakpoint

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_REPL_HISTORY_FILE`** | string | History file used by `dybatpho::breakpoint` |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`dybatpho::expect_args`](#dybatphoexpect_args) — Validate function arguments and assign them into named local variables.
- [`dybatpho::still_has_args`](#dybatphostill_has_args) — Check whether at least one more positional argument remains after the current one. This helper is useful while manually parsing a shifting argument list.
- [`dybatpho::expect_envs`](#dybatphoexpect_envs) — Ensure that required environment variables are set.
- [`dybatpho::require`](#dybatphorequire) — Ensure that a required command is installed, and new enough. With a version range, the command is asked what version it is through `dybatpho::command_version`, the answer is normalized by `dybatpho::semver_coerce`, and the result is matched with `dybatpho::semver_satisfies`. The range is written the way that function documents it: `>=1.6`, `^4`, `>=1.2 <2`, `1.2.x`, or alternatives with `||`. The range has to open with one of `>`, `<`, `=`, `^`, or `~`. A bare `4` is a valid range on its own elsewhere, but this argument has meant an exit code since before ranges existed here, and no amount of cleverness makes `require jq 3` mean both things at once. Matching a version needs the optional `semver` module. Rather than let a range pass unchecked in a script that did not load it, this stops with a message naming what to load: a requirement that is silently not enforced is worse than one that was never written. A command whose version cannot be read is also a failure, for the same reason. `dybatpho::doctor` treats that case as a report rather than a failure, because a report is allowed to say "I could not tell".
- [`dybatpho::command_exists_all`](#dybatphocommand_exists_all) — Return success when all listed commands are available.
- [`dybatpho::is`](#dybatphois) — Check whether a value matches a supported shell-oriented condition.
- [`dybatpho::coalesce`](#dybatphocoalesce) — Print the first non-empty value from a list of fallbacks.
- [`dybatpho::coalesce_cmd`](#dybatphocoalesce_cmd) — Print the first available command from a list of candidates.
- [`dybatpho::default_env`](#dybatphodefault_env) — Assign and export a default value for an environment variable when it is empty.
- [`dybatpho::require_envs_any`](#dybatphorequire_envs_any) — Ensure that at least one of the listed environment variables is set.
- [`dybatpho::assert`](#dybatphoassert) — Evaluate a shell condition string and stop with a message when it fails.
- [`dybatpho::retry`](#dybatphoretry) — Retry a shell command with escalating delays until it succeeds or retries are exhausted.
- [`dybatpho::retry_until`](#dybatphoretry_until) — Retry a shell command until it succeeds or the retry budget is exhausted, using a fixed delay.
- [`dybatpho::breakpoint`](#dybatphobreakpoint) — Open an interactive breakpoint for debugging a running script.

## 🚀 Usage

### When to use this module


Use `helpers.sh` when you want to:


- make shell functions fail fast on bad input
- avoid repeating `command -v`, `[[ -f ... ]]`, `[[ -d ... ]]`, and similar checks
- validate that any or all required commands and env vars are present
- choose the first non-empty value from environment, defaults, or arguments
- assign fallback defaults into environment variables
- retry transient commands without rewriting loop logic
- inspect runtime state interactively while debugging a script


### Common patterns


#### Validate function input


```bash
function copy_file() {
  local src dst
  dybatpho::expect_args src dst -- "$@"
  cp "${src}" "${dst}"
}
```


#### Require environment + binary before running


```bash
dybatpho::expect_envs API_TOKEN
dybatpho::require curl
```


#### Guard conditions


```bash
if ! dybatpho::is file "${config_path}"; then
  dybatpho::die "Config file not found: ${config_path}"
fi
```


#### Retry transient network operations


```bash
dybatpho::retry 4 "curl -fsSL '${health_url}'" "service health check"
```


#### Pick the first configured value


```bash
api_host="$(dybatpho::coalesce "${API_HOST:-}" "${FALLBACK_HOST:-}" "http://localhost:8080")"
```


#### Pick the first available command


```bash
json_tool="$(dybatpho::coalesce_cmd jq yq python3)"
```


#### Add an optional breakpoint


```bash
dybatpho::is true "${DEBUG_BREAK:-false}" && dybatpho::breakpoint
```

## 💡 Tips

- Combine `dybatpho::expect_envs` and `dybatpho::require` near the top of entrypoint scripts to fail fast on missing configuration or dependencies.

### `dybatpho::expect_args`

- Prefer calling this at the top of reusable functions instead of manually unpacking `$@`

### `dybatpho::require`

- Prefer this over repeating inline `command -v ... || exit` checks throughout a script

### `dybatpho::is`

- Use this helper to keep calling code readable instead of scattering shell test syntax across the script

### `dybatpho::assert`

- The assertion command is executed with `eval`

### `dybatpho::retry`

- The command is executed with `eval`, so pass it as one shell command string
- Pass a short description when the raw command is noisy so retry logs stay readable

### `dybatpho::retry_until`

- The command is executed with `eval`, so pass it as one shell command string

### `dybatpho::breakpoint`

- This helper is intended for interactive local debugging, not unattended CI or production runs

## 📚 Reference

### `dybatpho::expect_args`

Validate function arguments and assign them into named local variables.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
local arg1 arg2 .. argN
dybatpho::expect_args arg1 arg2 .. argN -- "$@"

```

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script if the specification is invalid or required arguments are missing
- `0`: Assign arguments to the requested variable names and return successfully


---

### `dybatpho::still_has_args`

Check whether at least one more positional argument remains after the current one.
This helper is useful while manually parsing a shifting argument list.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
while dybatpho::still_has_args "$@" && shift; do
  echo "Function has next argument is $1"
done
```

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: Still has an argument
- `1`: No additional arguments remain


---

### `dybatpho::expect_envs`

Ensure that required environment variables are set.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::expect_envs ENV_VAR1 ENV_VAR2
```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$@` | string | Environment variables to check |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script if any variable is unset or empty


---

### `dybatpho::require`

Ensure that a required command is installed, and new enough.
  With a version range, the command is asked what version it is through
  `dybatpho::command_version`, the answer is normalized by
  `dybatpho::semver_coerce`, and the result is matched with
  `dybatpho::semver_satisfies`. The range is written the way that function
  documents it: `>=1.6`, `^4`, `>=1.2 <2`, `1.2.x`, or alternatives with `||`.


  The range has to open with one of `>`, `<`, `=`, `^`, or `~`. A bare `4`
  is a valid range on its own elsewhere, but this argument has meant an exit
  code since before ranges existed here, and no amount of cleverness makes
  `require jq 3` mean both things at once.


  Matching a version needs the optional `semver` module. Rather than let a
  range pass unchecked in a script that did not load it, this stops with a
  message naming what to load: a requirement that is silently not enforced is
  worse than one that was never written.


  A command whose version cannot be read is also a failure, for the same
  reason. `dybatpho::doctor` treats that case as a report rather than a
  failure, because a report is allowed to say "I could not tell".

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::require git
dybatpho::require jq '>=1.6'
dybatpho::require yq '^4' 3

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Command that must be available |
| `$2` | string | Version range opening with an operator, or the exit code |
| `$3` | number | Exit code when a range was given (default 127) |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `127`: Stop script if command isn't installed, or is outside the range
- `0`: The command is available and satisfies the range
- `other`: Exit code given as an argument, instead of 127
