## ✨ Overview

Where `ai.sh` lets a script call a model, this module points the other way:
it makes a script something a model can drive safely. A tool that an agent
invokes has different needs from one a person types — it must say what it
did in a form that parses, it must never block on a prompt nobody will
answer, it must refuse dangerous work it was not explicitly cleared for,
and it must leave a record of what an agent made it do.


The module provides five things:


- **Detection** – is this run being driven by an agent, or by a person?
- **Structured results and errors** – JSON for agents, plain text for people,
  from the same call site
- **Tool definitions** – Anthropic, OpenAI, and MCP tool schemas generated
  from the same `cli.sh` option spec that drives the parser, so they cannot
  drift apart
- **An allowlist gate** – interactive confirmation for people, an explicit
  allowlist for agents, never a silent yes
- **An audit trail** – one JSON line per agent-initiated action



### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_AGENT_MODE`** | string | `auto` (default), `on`, or `off` |
| **`DYBATPHO_AGENT_ALLOW`** | string | Space separated actions an agent may perform, or `all` |
| **`DYBATPHO_AGENT_AUDIT_FILE`** | string | Path of the JSON Lines audit log |
| **`DYBATPHO_AGENT_ENV`** | string | Extra environment variable names that mark an agent run |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_agent_require_json`](#__dybatpho_agent_require_json) — Fail loudly when no JSON backend is installed.
- [`__dybatpho_agent_marker_present`](#__dybatpho_agent_marker_present) — Return success when an agent runtime marker is present.
- [`dybatpho::agent_mode`](#dybatphoagent_mode) — Print whether this run is being driven by an agent. `auto` looks for a known runtime marker; `on` and `off` skip detection.
- [`dybatpho::agent_detect`](#dybatphoagent_detect) — Return success when an agent is driving this run.
- [`dybatpho::agent_result`](#dybatphoagent_result) — Report the outcome of an operation in the caller's language. Agents get one JSON object on stdout; people get an aligned key/value line.
- [`dybatpho::agent_error`](#dybatphoagent_error) — Report a failure with a machine-readable code and a fix hint.
- [`dybatpho::agent_context`](#dybatphoagent_context) — Describe the environment an agent is operating in.
- [`__dybatpho_agent_allowed`](#__dybatpho_agent_allowed) — Return success when an action appears in the agent allowlist.
- [`dybatpho::agent_confirm`](#dybatphoagent_confirm) — Gate an action behind confirmation, or behind an allowlist. A person is asked; an agent is checked against `DYBATPHO_AGENT_ALLOW` and refused when the action was not cleared in advance. Either way the decision is written to the audit log.
- [`dybatpho::agent_audit`](#dybatphoagent_audit) — Append one action to the audit log. Records are JSON Lines so a later run, or a human, can replay what an agent did without parsing prose.
- [`dybatpho::agent_audit_show`](#dybatphoagent_audit_show) — Print the audit log as readable lines.
- [`__dybatpho_agent_flatten_schema`](#__dybatpho_agent_flatten_schema) — Turn a CLI schema into a flat list of callable commands. Each command carries the options it accepts, with hidden entries dropped. The tree is walked here rather than in a filter because only one of the two JSON backends supports user-defined functions, and a schema can nest.
- [`__dybatpho_agent_flatten_command`](#__dybatpho_agent_flatten_command) — Append one command and its subcommands to a flat list.
- [`__dybatpho_agent_options_schema`](#__dybatpho_agent_options_schema) — Build a JSON Schema object from a command's option list. Flags become booleans, parameters become strings, `choices:` becomes an `enum`, and `multiple:true` becomes an array of that item type.
- [`dybatpho::agent_tools`](#dybatphoagent_tools) — Generate tool definitions from a CLI option spec. The root command and every subcommand become one tool, named by joining the command path with underscores. Because the definitions come from the same spec the parser uses, a tool can never describe an option the CLI does not have.
- [`__dybatpho_agent_tool_name`](#__dybatpho_agent_tool_name) — Derive a callable tool name from a flattened command entry. The command path is joined with underscores and anything a tool name may not contain is replaced, so a prefix with a space still yields a valid name.
- [`dybatpho::agent_mcp`](#dybatphoagent_mcp) — Generate an MCP `tools/list` payload for a CLI option spec. Each tool carries the command line it maps to under `x-dybatpho-command`, so a thin MCP server can dispatch without a second source of truth.

## 🚀 Usage

### When to use this module


Use `agent.sh` when you want to:


- expose an existing CLI to Claude, an MCP client, or a function-calling loop
- keep a script safe when something non-human is choosing its arguments
- return results an agent can branch on instead of prose it has to guess at
- know afterwards which actions an agent took, and which it was refused


### Common patterns


#### Answer in the caller's language


```bash
dybatpho::agent_result ok deployed=api version=1.4.2
# agent mode: {"status":"ok","deployed":"api","version":"1.4.2"}
# human mode: status=ok deployed=api version=1.4.2
```


#### Publish the CLI as tools


```bash
dybatpho::agent_tools _spec_root mytool anthropic  # Claude tool definitions
dybatpho::agent_tools _spec_root mytool openai     # function-calling schema
dybatpho::agent_mcp _spec_root mytool              # MCP tools/list payload
```


#### Gate a dangerous action


```bash
export DYBATPHO_AGENT_ALLOW="restart"
dybatpho::agent_confirm restart "Restart the API service" \
  && systemctl restart api
```

## 💡 Tips

- Agent mode is detected automatically; force it either way with `DYBATPHO_AGENT_MODE` @note Tool definitions are generated from the live option spec, so a new flag becomes a new tool parameter without a second edit

### `dybatpho::agent_result`

- Keep status words to a small fixed set so an agent can branch on them

### `dybatpho::agent_error`

- Error codes are a contract; keep them stable across releases so an agent can branch on them

### `dybatpho::agent_context`

- Call this first in an agent-facing subcommand so the model knows what it is working with before it acts

### `dybatpho::agent_confirm`

- Never add `all` to the allowlist in a production runbook; list the actions you actually intend to delegate

### `dybatpho::agent_tools`

- Feed the result straight into the tool registry of the `ai` module, or into an API request; it needs no hand editing

---

### `__dybatpho_agent_flatten_schema`

Turn a CLI schema into a flat list of callable commands.
Each command carries the options it accepts, with hidden entries dropped.
The tree is walked here rather than in a filter because only one of the two
JSON backends supports user-defined functions, and a schema can nest.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | CLI schema JSON from `dybatpho::generate_schema` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- JSON array of `{path, description, options}` objects

| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Command node JSON |
| `$2` | string | Path of the parent command, as a JSON array |
| `$3` | string | Accumulated list JSON |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The list with this command and its descendants appended


---

### `__dybatpho_agent_options_schema`

Build a JSON Schema object from a command's option list.
Flags become booleans, parameters become strings, `choices:` becomes an
`enum`, and `multiple:true` becomes an array of that item type.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Options array JSON |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- JSON Schema object


---

### `dybatpho::agent_tools`

Generate tool definitions from a CLI option spec.
The root command and every subcommand become one tool, named by joining the
command path with underscores. Because the definitions come from the same
spec the parser uses, a tool can never describe an option the CLI does not
have.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::agent_tools _spec_root mytool            # Anthropic shape
dybatpho::agent_tools _spec_root mytool openai     # function-calling shape

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Spec function, the same one passed to `dybatpho::generate_from_spec` |
| `$2` | string | Tool name prefix, default is the script name |
| `$3` | string | Output shape, `anthropic` (default) or `openai` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- JSON array of tool definitions

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The definitions were printed
- `1`: Missing arguments or an unknown output shape

**🔗 See also**

- [dybatpho::generate_schema](#dybatphogenerate_schema)


---

### `__dybatpho_agent_tool_name`

Derive a callable tool name from a flattened command entry.
The command path is joined with underscores and anything a tool name may not
contain is replaced, so a prefix with a space still yields a valid name.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Flattened command entry JSON |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Tool name


---

### `dybatpho::agent_mcp`

Generate an MCP `tools/list` payload for a CLI option spec.
Each tool carries the command line it maps to under `x-dybatpho-command`, so
a thin MCP server can dispatch without a second source of truth.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::agent_mcp _spec_root mytool > mytool-mcp.json

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Spec function |
| `$2` | string | Server and tool name prefix, default is the script name |
| `$3` | string | Command an MCP server should execute, default is the script path |

**📝 Notes**

- This is the tool manifest, not a running server; point your MCP host at it and dispatch with the recorded command

**📤 Output on stdout**

- JSON object with `name`, `version`, and a `tools` array

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The payload was printed
- `1`: Missing arguments
