## ✨ Overview

This module contains helpers for reading the current time, validating date
strings, converting between Unix timestamps and formatted dates, shifting a
date by a span of time, measuring the distance between two dates, bounding
the month a date falls in, and writing a number of seconds as a clock.


Spans are measured in units that are a fixed number of seconds: seconds,
minutes, hours, days, and weeks. Months and years are left out, because
their length depends on where in the calendar they fall and the two `date`
implementations this module supports shift by them differently.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_DATE_TIMEZONE`** | string | Timezone used by date helpers, default is `UTC` |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_date_is_gnu`](#__dybatpho_date_is_gnu) — 
- [`__dybatpho_date_parse`](#__dybatpho_date_parse) — 
- [`dybatpho::date_now`](#dybatphodate_now) — Print the current time using a `date` format string.
- [`dybatpho::date_today`](#dybatphodate_today) — Print today's date using a `date` format string.
- [`dybatpho::date_is_valid`](#dybatphodate_is_valid) — Return success when a date string can be parsed by `date`.
- [`dybatpho::date_parse`](#dybatphodate_parse) — Parse a date string and print its Unix timestamp.
- [`dybatpho::date_format`](#dybatphodate_format) — Format a Unix timestamp with a `date` format string.
- [`dybatpho::date_add_days`](#dybatphodate_add_days) — Add or subtract days from a date string and print the result.
- [`dybatpho::date_diff_days`](#dybatphodate_diff_days) — Print the whole-day difference between two date strings.
- [`__dybatpho_date_unit_seconds`](#__dybatpho_date_unit_seconds) — Print how many seconds one unit of time is worth. Only units that are a fixed number of seconds are offered. A month and a year are not: their length depends on where in the calendar they fall, and GNU and BSD `date` disagree on how to shift by one, so a helper that took them would give a different answer per platform.
- [`dybatpho::date_is_leap_year`](#dybatphodate_is_leap_year) — Return success when a year is a leap year. Every fourth year, except centuries, except every fourth century. The middle rule is the one that gets left out, and 1900 is the year that catches it.
- [`dybatpho::date_days_in_month`](#dybatphodate_days_in_month) — Print how many days a month has.
- [`dybatpho::date_month_start`](#dybatphodate_month_start) — Print the first day of the month a date falls in.
- [`dybatpho::date_month_end`](#dybatphodate_month_end) — Print the last day of the month a date falls in. This is the date a billing period or a report window ends on, worked out from the calendar rather than by adding a month and stepping back a day, which lands in the wrong place whenever the two months differ in length.
- [`dybatpho::date_add`](#dybatphodate_add) — Add or subtract a span of time from a date string. The units are the ones that are a fixed number of seconds: seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks. Months and years are left out on purpose, since their length depends on the calendar and the two `date` implementations this module supports shift by them differently.
- [`dybatpho::date_diff`](#dybatphodate_diff) — Print the difference between two dates in a chosen unit. The result is truncated toward zero, so a span of 47 hours is one day rather than two, and it is signed: an end before the start is negative.
- [`dybatpho::date_seconds_to_hms`](#dybatphodate_seconds_to_hms) — Print a number of seconds as `H:MM:SS`. The hours are not wrapped at a day, so a span of 90000 seconds reads as `25:00:00`: this is a length of time rather than a time of day. A negative span keeps its sign. For a duration written the way a sentence would put it, in the reader's own language, `dybatpho::i18n_duration` is the one to call.

---

### `dybatpho::date_month_end`

Print the last day of the month a date falls in.
  This is the date a billing period or a report window ends on, worked out
  from the calendar rather than by adding a month and stepping back a day,
  which lands in the wrong place whenever the two months differ in length.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::date_month_end 2024-02-17   # 2024-02-29

### `dybatpho::date_add`

Add or subtract a span of time from a date string.
  The units are the ones that are a fixed number of seconds: seconds,
  minutes, hours, days, and weeks. Months and years are left out on purpose,
  since their length depends on the calendar and the two `date`
  implementations this module supports shift by them differently.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::date_add 2024-02-28 1 days                 # 2024-02-29
dybatpho::date_add "2024-02-28 23:00:00" 2 hours '%F %T'
dybatpho::date_add 2024-03-01 -1 weeks               # 2024-02-23

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Base date string |
| `$2` | number | Amount, may be negative |
| `$3` | string | Unit: seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks |
| `$4` | string | Optional output format, default is `%F %T` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_DATE_TIMEZONE`** | string | Timezone used while parsing and formatting |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The shifted date

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The date cannot be parsed, the amount is not a whole number, or the unit is unknown

---

### `dybatpho::date_diff`

Print the difference between two dates in a chosen unit.
  The result is truncated toward zero, so a span of 47 hours is one day
  rather than two, and it is signed: an end before the start is negative.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::date_diff 2024-01-01 2024-03-01 days          # 60
dybatpho::date_diff "2024-01-01 00:00:00" "2024-01-01 01:30:00" minutes

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Start date string |
| `$2` | string | End date string |
| `$3` | string | Optional unit: seconds (default), minutes, hours, days, or weeks |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_DATE_TIMEZONE`** | string | Timezone used while parsing both dates |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Signed difference calculated as `end - start`

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Either date cannot be parsed, or the unit is unknown

**🔗 See also**

- [- `dybatpho::date_diff_days](#dybatphodate_diff_days)


---

### `dybatpho::date_seconds_to_hms`

Print a number of seconds as `H:MM:SS`.
  The hours are not wrapped at a day, so a span of 90000 seconds reads as
  `25:00:00`: this is a length of time rather than a time of day. A negative
  span keeps its sign.


  For a duration written the way a sentence would put it, in the reader's own
  language, `dybatpho::i18n_duration` is the one to call.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::date_seconds_to_hms 3661    # 1:01:01
dybatpho::date_seconds_to_hms 90000   # 25:00:00
dybatpho::date_seconds_to_hms -61     # -0:01:01

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | number | Whole number of seconds, may be negative |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The span as `H:MM:SS`

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Stop the script when the value is not a whole number
