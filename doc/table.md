## ✨ Overview

This module contains helpers for rendering delimited row data as aligned
plain text, Unicode boxed tables, or Markdown tables. It also supports
explicit plain-table alignment rules and lightweight CSV rendering. It
targets small script-generated tables where readability matters more than
strict CSV parsing.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_TABLE_CSV_STRICT`** | bool | Refuse input whose fields are quoted, rather than splitting through the quotes. Default `true` |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_table_cell_width`](#__dybatpho_table_cell_width) — Return the display width of a table cell.
- [`__dybatpho_table_pad`](#__dybatpho_table_pad) — Pad a cell to the requested display width.
- [`__dybatpho_table_split_row`](#__dybatpho_table_split_row) — Split one delimited row into trimmed cells.
- [`__dybatpho_table_measure_widths`](#__dybatpho_table_measure_widths) — Measure the widest cell in each column across all rows.
- [`__dybatpho_table_parse_alignments`](#__dybatpho_table_parse_alignments) — Normalize a per-column alignment specification.
- [`__dybatpho_table_format_cell`](#__dybatpho_table_format_cell) — Format a cell according to width and alignment.
- [`__dybatpho_table_rule`](#__dybatpho_table_rule) — Print a Unicode rule line for a boxed table.
- [`dybatpho::table_print`](#dybatphotable_print) — Render aligned columns without borders from delimited rows.
- [`dybatpho::table_align`](#dybatphotable_align) — Render aligned columns with optional per-column alignment rules.
- [`dybatpho::table_box`](#dybatphotable_box) — Render a Unicode boxed table from delimited rows.
- [`dybatpho::table_markdown`](#dybatphotable_markdown) — Render a Markdown table from delimited rows.
- [`__dybatpho_table_reject_quoted`](#__dybatpho_table_reject_quoted) — Stop when a row looks like quoted CSV, which this module does not parse. `dybatpho::table_csv` splits on every comma. That is the right thing for the delimiter-convenience case it exists for — `... | tr -s ' ' ',' | dybatpho::table_csv -` — and the wrong thing for a real CSV file, where a quoted field may contain a comma of its own. Splitting through the quotes turned one field into two, so the row no longer matched its header, and nothing said so: the table was simply wrong, and wrong in a way that looks like data. Refusing is not a parser, and does not pretend to be one. It converts silent corruption into an error that names the limitation, which is the part that actually hurt. `DYBATPHO_TABLE_CSV_STRICT=false` restores the old splitting for callers who know their data carries no quoting.
- [`dybatpho::table_csv`](#dybatphotable_csv) — Render lightweight comma-delimited table data using one of the supported styles.

## 💡 Tips

- Rows are provided as a single multi-line string (or stdin with `-`), and cells are split on an exact delimiter such as `|`, `,`, or `::`

---

### `__dybatpho_table_reject_quoted`

Stop when a row looks like quoted CSV, which this module does not
  parse.


  `dybatpho::table_csv` splits on every comma. That is the right thing for the
  delimiter-convenience case it exists for — `... | tr -s ' ' ',' |
  dybatpho::table_csv -` — and the wrong thing for a real CSV file, where a
  quoted field may contain a comma of its own. Splitting through the quotes
  turned one field into two, so the row no longer matched its header, and
  nothing said so: the table was simply wrong, and wrong in a way that looks
  like data.


  Refusing is not a parser, and does not pretend to be one. It converts silent
  corruption into an error that names the limitation, which is the part that
  actually hurt. `DYBATPHO_TABLE_CSV_STRICT=false` restores the old splitting
  for callers who know their data carries no quoting.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Rows to inspect |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_TABLE_CSV_STRICT`** | bool | Set to `false` to split through quotes anyway |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: No row is quoted, or the check is switched off
- `1`: Stop the script when a field is quoted


---

| `$2` | string | Optional style: `plain`, `box`, or `markdown`, default is `plain` |
| `$3` | string | Optional comma-separated alignments for `plain` style |

**📤 Output on stdout**
