## b version

Print the version number of Projekt tools

### Synopsis


Show the version for Projekt tools.

This will print a representation the version of Projekt.
The output will look something like this:

Projekt CLI version.BuildInfo{Version:"vx.x.x", GitCommit:"ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"gox.x.x", BuildTime:"xxxx-xx-xxTxx:xx:xxZ"}

- Version is the semantic version of the release.
- GitCommit is the SHA for the commit that this version was built from.
- GitTreeState is "clean" if there are no local code changes when this binary was
  built, and "dirty" if the binary was built from locally modified code.
- GoVersion is the version of Go that was used to compile Projekt.
- BuildTime is the time when Projekt was compiled.

When using the --template flag the following properties are available to use in
the template:

- .Version contains the semantic version of Projekt
- .GitCommit is the git commit
- .GitTreeState is the state of the git tree when Projekt was built
- .GoVersion contains the version of Go that Projekt was compiled with
- .BuildTime contains the time when Projekt was compiled

For example, --template='Version: {{.Version}}' outputs 'Version: vx.x.x'.
