## ✨ Overview

`git.sh` reads the repository on disk and `release.sh` builds, checksums and
signs artifacts — and then stops. Nothing in the library publishes anything.
This module closes that gap: it turns a Git remote into an authenticated API
client for the forge behind it, and exposes the two things a release or CI
script actually needs from one — issues and releases.


**GitHub** (including GitHub Enterprise) and **GitLab** (including
self-hosted) are both supported. The forge is detected from the remote URL,
so a script that works against `github.com` works against a company GitLab
without changing a line. Everything that differs between the two — the API
base, the auth header, how a project is addressed in a path, and what the
fields are called — is resolved behind the public functions.


Tokens are read from the environment and registered with `secret.sh`, so a
token can never reach a log line even when a request is traced.



### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORGE`** | string | Force the forge kind, `github` or `gitlab`, instead of detecting it |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORGE_REMOTE`** | string | Git remote the forge is detected from, default `origin` |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORGE_API`** | string | Override the API base URL, for a forge on a path detection cannot guess |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORGE_REPO`** | string | Override the detected `owner/repo` |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORGE_TOKEN`** | string | Token to authenticate with, preferred over the per-forge variables |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`__dybatpho_forge_normalize_url`](#__dybatpho_forge_normalize_url) — Normalize a Git remote URL into `host/owner/repo`. Handles the three forms a remote takes — `git@host:owner/repo.git`, `ssh://git@host/owner/repo.git` and `https://host/owner/repo.git` — so the rest of the module never has to care which one a checkout uses.
- [`dybatpho::forge_host`](#dybatphoforge_host) — Print the host of the configured remote.
- [`dybatpho::forge_kind`](#dybatphoforge_kind) — Print which forge the repository is hosted on. `DYBATPHO_FORGE` wins when set, so a mirror or an unrecognizable host name never has to be guessed at.
- [`dybatpho::forge_repo`](#dybatphoforge_repo) — Print the `owner/repo` the remote points at. A GitLab project may be nested in subgroups, so everything after the host is kept rather than only the last two segments.
- [`dybatpho::forge_api`](#dybatphoforge_api) — Print the API base URL for the repository's forge. `github.com` answers on a separate API host; every other GitHub is an Enterprise install serving `/api/v3` from the same host. GitLab always serves `/api/v4` from its own host.
- [`dybatpho::forge_token`](#dybatphoforge_token) — Print the token used to authenticate against the forge. The token is registered with `secret.sh` before it is returned, so a later log line containing it is masked instead. That registration only reaches the shell this function runs in. Capturing the token with `token="$(dybatpho::forge_token)"` runs it in a subshell, which takes the registration with it when it exits — a Bash property no function can work around. A script that holds the token itself should register it once, in its own shell: ```bash token="$(dybatpho::forge_token)" dybatpho::secret_register "${token}" ``` The module never logs the token, so this matters for what the calling script does with it rather than for the requests made here.
- [`__dybatpho_forge_token_vars`](#__dybatpho_forge_token_vars) — Name the environment variables a forge reads its token from.
- [`__dybatpho_forge_project_path`](#__dybatpho_forge_project_path) — Print the path segment that identifies the project on this forge. GitHub addresses a repository as `repos/owner/name`. GitLab addresses a project by its URL-encoded path, so the separating slashes become `%2F`.
- [`__dybatpho_forge_labels_json`](#__dybatpho_forge_labels_json) — Turn a comma-separated label list into a JSON array. GitHub wants `["a","b"]`; GitLab takes the comma-separated string as-is, so only GitHub needs this.
- [`__dybatpho_forge_auth_header`](#__dybatpho_forge_auth_header) — Print the authentication header this forge expects.
- [`dybatpho::forge_request`](#dybatphoforge_request) — Make an authenticated request against the forge API. The path is relative to the project, so callers write `issues` rather than repeating the API base and the project identifier on every call.
- [`dybatpho::forge_issue_find`](#dybatphoforge_issue_find) — Print the number of an open issue whose title matches exactly. GitLab can filter server-side; GitHub cannot search titles on the issues endpoint, so the open issues are compared here. Both are exact matches, so "Build failing" never collides with "Build failing on macOS".
- [`dybatpho::forge_issue_create`](#dybatphoforge_issue_create) — Open an issue and print its number.
- [`dybatpho::forge_issue_comment`](#dybatphoforge_issue_comment) — Add a comment to an existing issue.
- [`dybatpho::forge_issue_report`](#dybatphoforge_issue_report) — Report something once, then keep reporting to the same issue. A script that runs on a schedule should not open a new issue on every failure. This opens one the first time and comments on it afterwards, and says in its output which of the two it did so a pipeline can react.
- [`dybatpho::forge_issue_url`](#dybatphoforge_issue_url) — Print the browser URL of an issue.
- [`dybatpho::forge_release_find`](#dybatphoforge_release_find) — Print the identifier of the release for a tag. GitHub assets are attached by numeric release id; GitLab addresses a release by its tag. Each forge returns the identifier its own upload step needs.
- [`dybatpho::forge_release_create`](#dybatphoforge_release_create) — Create a release for a tag and print its identifier. The tag must already exist on the forge; this publishes the release that points at it rather than creating the tag.
- [`dybatpho::forge_release_upload`](#dybatphoforge_release_upload) — Attach a file to an existing release and print its URL. The two forges do genuinely different things here. GitHub stores the asset itself, on a separate upload host. GitLab stores nothing on a release: the file goes to the project's generic package registry and the release gains a link pointing at it. Both end with the file reachable from the release page.

## 🚀 Usage

### When to use this module


Use `forge.sh` when you want to:


- publish the artifacts `release.sh` produced
- report a CI failure without opening the same issue on every run
- read release metadata back out of the forge


### Common patterns


#### Publish what `release.sh` built


```bash
. dybatpho/init.sh --modules release forge
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_..."


version="$(dybatpho::release_next_version)"
dybatpho::release_package "dist" "v${version}" linux amd64
dybatpho::forge_release_create "v${version}" "v${version}" "$(dybatpho::release_changelog)"
dybatpho::forge_release_upload "v${version}" "dist/app-v${version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
```


#### Report a failure once, then keep commenting on it


```bash
dybatpho::forge_issue_report \
  "Nightly build is failing" \
  "Run ${CI_RUN_URL} failed at $(dybatpho::date_now)" \
  "ci"
```


The first run opens the issue; every run after that adds a comment to the
one that is already open. The JSON it prints says which of the two happened,
so a pipeline can branch on it:


```bash
result="$(dybatpho::forge_issue_report "$title" "$body")"
if [[ "$(dybatpho::json_get "${result}" '.action')" == "created" ]]; then
  dybatpho::notify_slack "New failure: $(dybatpho::json_get "${result}" '.url')"
fi
```


#### Point at a self-hosted forge


Detection follows the remote, so normally nothing is needed. Override it
when the remote is a mirror, or when the host name gives nothing away:


```bash
export DYBATPHO_FORGE=gitlab
export DYBATPHO_FORGE_API="https://git.internal/api/v4"
export DYBATPHO_FORGE_TOKEN="glpat-..."
```

## 📚 Reference

### `__dybatpho_forge_normalize_url`

Normalize a Git remote URL into `host/owner/repo`.
  Handles the three forms a remote takes — `git@host:owner/repo.git`,
  `ssh://git@host/owner/repo.git` and `https://host/owner/repo.git` — so the
  rest of the module never has to care which one a checkout uses.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Remote URL |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- `host/owner/repo`


---

### `dybatpho::forge_host`

Print the host of the configured remote.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional remote name, default `DYBATPHO_FORGE_REMOTE` |
| `$2` | string | Optional repository path, default `.` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Host name

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The remote has no URL


---

### `dybatpho::forge_kind`

Print which forge the repository is hosted on.
  `DYBATPHO_FORGE` wins when set, so a mirror or an unrecognizable host name
  never has to be guessed at.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
case "$(dybatpho::forge_kind)" in
  github) ... ;;
  gitlab) ... ;;
esac

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional remote name, default `DYBATPHO_FORGE_REMOTE` |
| `$2` | string | Optional repository path, default `.` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORGE`** | string | Forced forge kind |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- `github` or `gitlab`

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The host matches neither forge and `DYBATPHO_FORGE` is unset


---

### `dybatpho::forge_repo`

Print the `owner/repo` the remote points at.
  A GitLab project may be nested in subgroups, so everything after the host is
  kept rather than only the last two segments.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional remote name, default `DYBATPHO_FORGE_REMOTE` |
| `$2` | string | Optional repository path, default `.` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- `owner/repo`, or `group/subgroup/repo` on GitLab

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The remote URL carries no path


---

### `dybatpho::forge_api`

Print the API base URL for the repository's forge.
  `github.com` answers on a separate API host; every other GitHub is an
  Enterprise install serving `/api/v3` from the same host. GitLab always
  serves `/api/v4` from its own host.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional remote name, default `DYBATPHO_FORGE_REMOTE` |
| `$2` | string | Optional repository path, default `.` |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORGE_API`** | string | Override the computed value |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- API base URL, without a trailing slash
  this module have no remote of their own to pass and rely on the defaults


---

### `dybatpho::forge_token`

Print the token used to authenticate against the forge.
  The token is registered with `secret.sh` before it is returned, so a later
  log line containing it is masked instead.


  That registration only reaches the shell this function runs in. Capturing
  the token with `token="$(dybatpho::forge_token)"` runs it in a subshell,
  which takes the registration with it when it exits — a Bash property no
  function can work around. A script that holds the token itself should
  register it once, in its own shell:


  ```bash
  token="$(dybatpho::forge_token)"
  dybatpho::secret_register "${token}"
  ```


  The module never logs the token, so this matters for what the calling
  script does with it rather than for the requests made here.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional forge kind, detected when omitted |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_FORGE_TOKEN`** | string | Checked first, whatever the forge |
| **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** | string | GitHub token, with `GH_TOKEN` as a fallback |
| **`GITLAB_TOKEN`** | string | GitLab token, with `CI_JOB_TOKEN` as a fallback |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- `1`: No token is set for this forge


---

### `__dybatpho_forge_token_vars`

Name the environment variables a forge reads its token from.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Forge kind |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Human-readable list for an error message


---

### `__dybatpho_forge_project_path`

Print the path segment that identifies the project on this forge.
  GitHub addresses a repository as `repos/owner/name`. GitLab addresses a
  project by its URL-encoded path, so the separating slashes become `%2F`.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Forge kind |
| `$2` | string | `owner/repo` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Path segment, with no leading or trailing slash


---

### `__dybatpho_forge_labels_json`

Turn a comma-separated label list into a JSON array.
  GitHub wants `["a","b"]`; GitLab takes the comma-separated string as-is, so
  only GitHub needs this.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Comma-separated labels |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- JSON array of strings


---

### `__dybatpho_forge_auth_header`

Print the authentication header this forge expects.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Forge kind |
| `$2` | string | Token |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Header in `Name: value` form


---

### `dybatpho::forge_request`

Make an authenticated request against the forge API.
  The path is relative to the project, so callers write `issues` rather than
  repeating the API base and the project identifier on every call.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
local body
dybatpho::create_temp body ".json"
dybatpho::forge_request GET "issues?state=open" "" "${body}"
dybatpho::json_get "$(< "${body}")" '.[0].title'

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | HTTP method |
| `$2` | string | Path relative to the project, or an absolute URL |
| `$3` | string | Optional JSON request body |
| `$4` | string | Optional file the response body is written to, default `/dev/null` |
| `$@` | string | Additional curl options |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`DYBATPHO_HTTP_STATUS`**: The response status code

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The forge answered with a 2xx status
- `4`: The forge answered with a 4xx status
- `5`: The forge answered with a 5xx status


---

### `dybatpho::forge_issue_find`

Print the number of an open issue whose title matches exactly.
  GitLab can filter server-side; GitHub cannot search titles on the issues
  endpoint, so the open issues are compared here. Both are exact matches, so
  "Build failing" never collides with "Build failing on macOS".

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Issue title |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Issue number, or nothing when no open issue has that title

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: A matching issue exists
- `1`: No open issue has that title


---

### `dybatpho::forge_issue_create`

Open an issue and print its number.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Issue title |
| `$2` | string | Issue body |
| `$3` | string | Optional comma-separated labels |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Number of the created issue

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The forge rejected the request


---

### `dybatpho::forge_issue_comment`

Add a comment to an existing issue.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Issue number |
| `$2` | string | Comment body |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The forge rejected the request


---

### `dybatpho::forge_issue_report`

Report something once, then keep reporting to the same issue.
  A script that runs on a schedule should not open a new issue on every
  failure. This opens one the first time and comments on it afterwards, and
  says in its output which of the two it did so a pipeline can react.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
result="$(dybatpho::forge_issue_report "Nightly build failing" "${log_url}" ci)"
dybatpho::json_get "${result}" '.action'   # created | commented

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Issue title, also the identity used to find an existing issue |
| `$2` | string | Body of the issue or of the comment |
| `$3` | string | Optional comma-separated labels, applied only when creating |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- JSON object with `action`, `number` and `url`

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The forge rejected the request


---

### `dybatpho::forge_issue_url`

Print the browser URL of an issue.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Issue number |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Issue URL


---

### `dybatpho::forge_release_find`

Print the identifier of the release for a tag.
  GitHub assets are attached by numeric release id; GitLab addresses a release
  by its tag. Each forge returns the identifier its own upload step needs.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Tag name |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Release id on GitHub, tag name on GitLab

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: A release exists for the tag
- `1`: No release exists for the tag


---

### `dybatpho::forge_release_create`

Create a release for a tag and print its identifier.
  The tag must already exist on the forge; this publishes the release that
  points at it rather than creating the tag.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::forge_release_create "v1.2.0" "v1.2.0" "$(dybatpho::release_changelog)"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Tag name |
| `$2` | string | Optional release title, default is the tag |
| `$3` | string | Optional release notes |
| `$4` | string | Optional `true` to create the release as a draft |

**📝 Notes**

- GitLab has no draft release, so asking for one there is an error rather than a release published by surprise

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Release id on GitHub, tag name on GitLab

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The forge rejected the request, or a draft was asked of GitLab


---

### `dybatpho::forge_release_upload`

Attach a file to an existing release and print its URL.
  The two forges do genuinely different things here. GitHub stores the asset
  itself, on a separate upload host. GitLab stores nothing on a release: the
  file goes to the project's generic package registry and the release gains a
  link pointing at it. Both end with the file reachable from the release page.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
dybatpho::forge_release_upload "v1.2.0" "dist/app-v1.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Tag name of an existing release |
| `$2` | string | File to attach |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- URL the asset is reachable at

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The release does not exist, the file does not exist, or the upload failed
