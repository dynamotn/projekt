## ✨ Overview

This module contains helpers for previewing files, splitting, joining,
normalizing, comparing, and rewriting paths, creating temporary files
or directories that are cleaned up automatically on shell exit, and
reading or rewriting the contents of a file.


Every helper that changes a file writes through a staging file in the
destination directory and renames it into place, so a reader never observes
a half-written file and an interrupted run leaves the original intact. The
destination's mode is carried over, and its owner too when the process has
the privilege to set it. These helpers honor `DRY_RUN`.

### 🌍 Environment

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`DYBATPHO_FILE_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`** | string | When true-like, the default, helpers that rewrite a file write through a symlink instead of replacing it |

### 🚀 Highlights

- [`dybatpho::show_file`](#dybatphoshow_file) — Show the contents of a file with line numbers.
- [`dybatpho::path_dirname`](#dybatphopath_dirname) — Return the directory component of a path.
- [`dybatpho::path_basename`](#dybatphopath_basename) — Return the basename component of a path.
- [`dybatpho::path_extname`](#dybatphopath_extname) — Return the final extension of a path, including the leading dot.
- [`dybatpho::path_stem`](#dybatphopath_stem) — Return the basename of a path without its final extension.
- [`dybatpho::path_join`](#dybatphopath_join) — Join path segments with single `/` separators.
- [`dybatpho::path_normalize`](#dybatphopath_normalize) — Normalize a path by collapsing repeated separators and resolving `.` and `..` textually.
- [`dybatpho::path_is_abs`](#dybatphopath_is_abs) — Return success when a path is absolute.
- [`dybatpho::path_has_ext`](#dybatphopath_has_ext) — Return success when a path has any extension or a matching exact extension.
- [`dybatpho::path_change_ext`](#dybatphopath_change_ext) — Return a path with its final extension replaced.
- [`dybatpho::path_relative`](#dybatphopath_relative) — Return the relative path from a base path to a target path.
- [`dybatpho::create_temp`](#dybatphocreate_temp) — Create a temporary file or directory and register it for cleanup on shell exit.
- [`__dybatpho_file_stat`](#__dybatpho_file_stat) — Read one metadata field of a path across `stat` implementations. GNU and BusyBox `stat` take `-c`, BSD and macOS take `-f` with different format letters, so the GNU form is tried first and the BSD form second.
- [`__dybatpho_file_resolve`](#__dybatpho_file_resolve) — Follow a symlink chain to the file it ends at. Committing a rewrite means renaming a staging file onto the destination, which would replace a symlink with a regular file and quietly detach it from whatever it pointed at. Resolving first writes through the link instead, so a dotfile symlinked into a repository keeps pointing there and the file in the repository is the one that changes.
- [`__dybatpho_file_staging`](#__dybatpho_file_staging) — Print the path of a staging file next to a destination. The staging file has to share a directory with the destination, because `mv` is only atomic within one filesystem.
- [`__dybatpho_file_discard`](#__dybatpho_file_discard) — Remove a staging file that will not be committed.
- [`__dybatpho_file_operand`](#__dybatpho_file_operand) — Render a path that is safe to pass to a command that does not understand `--`. The BSD versions of `chmod`, `chown`, and `sed` on macOS treat `--` as a file name rather than as the end of the options, so a path that could be read as an option is prefixed with `./` instead.
- [`__dybatpho_file_commit`](#__dybatpho_file_commit) — Move a staging file onto its destination, carrying the destination's mode and owner over first so that the rename does not change how the file is accessed.
- [`dybatpho::file_write_atomic`](#dybatphofile_write_atomic) — Write standard input to a file through a staging file, so that readers see either the previous contents or the complete new contents.
- [`__dybatpho_file_sed_delimiter`](#__dybatpho_file_sed_delimiter) — Pick a `sed` substitution delimiter that appears in neither the pattern nor the replacement, so that neither has to be escaped.
- [`dybatpho::file_replace`](#dybatphofile_replace) — Substitute every match of a pattern in a file, in place.
- [`dybatpho::file_ensure_line`](#dybatphofile_ensure_line) — Append a line to a file unless the exact line is already there. Running it again changes nothing, which makes it safe for scripts that maintain a dotfile across repeated runs.
- [`dybatpho::file_remove_line`](#dybatphofile_remove_line) — Remove every occurrence of an exact line from a file. A file that never contained the line, or that does not exist, is left as is and reported as success: the line is absent either way.
- [`dybatpho::file_hash`](#dybatphofile_hash) — Print the checksum of a file.
- [`dybatpho::file_size`](#dybatphofile_size) — Print the size of a file in bytes.
- [`dybatpho::file_age_seconds`](#dybatphofile_age_seconds) — Print how many seconds have passed since a file was last modified.
- [`dybatpho::file_backup`](#dybatphofile_backup) — Copy a file next to itself under a timestamped name and print the copy's path, so that a caller can undo a change it is about to make.
- [`dybatpho::find_up`](#dybatphofind_up) — Search a directory and each of its parents for an entry, and print the first one found. This is how a tool locates the root of the project it was invoked inside, from wherever the caller happened to be.
- [`dybatpho::ensure_dir`](#dybatphoensure_dir) — Create a directory and every missing parent, then print its path. Running it again on an existing directory changes nothing, which lets a script call it before every write instead of guarding each one.
- [`__dybatpho_xdg_dir`](#__dybatpho_xdg_dir) — Print a directory from the XDG Base Directory specification, optionally scoped to one application. The specification's own default is used whenever the variable is unset or holds a relative path, which it requires to be ignored.
- [`dybatpho::xdg_config_dir`](#dybatphoxdg_config_dir) — Print the directory a program's configuration belongs in.
- [`dybatpho::xdg_cache_dir`](#dybatphoxdg_cache_dir) — Print the directory a program's cache belongs in.
- [`dybatpho::xdg_data_dir`](#dybatphoxdg_data_dir) — Print the directory a program's data belongs in.
- [`dybatpho::xdg_state_dir`](#dybatphoxdg_state_dir) — Print the directory a program's state belongs in. State is what a program wants back on the next run but should not be backed up, such as logs and history, which is what separates it from data.
- [`dybatpho::file_mtime`](#dybatphofile_mtime) — Print when a file was last modified, as a Unix timestamp.
- [`dybatpho::dir_size`](#dybatphodir_size) — Print the total size of the regular files in a directory tree. The result is the sum of the files' sizes rather than the disk space they occupy, so it matches `dybatpho::file_size` instead of `du`, whose block accounting and flags differ between platforms.
- [`dybatpho::file_is_binary`](#dybatphofile_is_binary) — Return success when a file looks like binary rather than text. A NUL byte in the first block is the signal `grep` and `git` use, and it is what makes a file unsafe to pass through line-oriented tools.
- [`dybatpho::create_temp_dir`](#dybatphocreate_temp_dir) — Create a temporary directory and register it for cleanup on shell exit. This is `dybatpho::create_temp` with the argument that asks for a directory already supplied, because passing `/` as an extension reads like a mistake.

## 💡 Tips

### `dybatpho::show_file`

- Uses `bat` when available for richer output, otherwise falls back to `cat -n`

### `dybatpho::create_temp`

- Pass `/` or an empty extension to create a directory instead of a file
- The created path is automatically registered for cleanup on script exit

### `dybatpho::file_write_atomic`

- The destination keeps its mode, and its owner when the process may set it

### `dybatpho::file_replace`

- This avoids `sed -i`, whose argument differs between GNU and BSD, by rewriting through a staging file instead

### `dybatpho::file_ensure_line`

- The comparison is an exact whole-line match, not a substring or pattern

### `dybatpho::file_remove_line`

- The comparison is an exact whole-line match, not a substring or pattern

### `dybatpho::file_hash`

- Falls back from the GNU `*sum` tools to `shasum`/`md5` and then `openssl`

### `dybatpho::file_backup`

- A second backup in the same second gets a numeric suffix, so an existing backup is never overwritten

### `dybatpho::find_up`

- Matches files and directories alike, so `.git` is found in a worktree, where it is a file, as well as in a normal clone

### `dybatpho::ensure_dir`

- A mode is applied whether the directory was just created or already existed, so the result does not depend on whether the script ran before

### `dybatpho::xdg_config_dir`

- These helpers only build a path; pair them with `dybatpho::ensure_dir` when the directory has to exist

### `dybatpho::file_mtime`

- `dybatpho::file_age_seconds` answers the same question relative to now

### `dybatpho::dir_size`

- Symbolic links are not counted at all, the way `du` treats them, so a link to a file inside the same tree cannot count its target twice

### `dybatpho::file_is_binary`

- Check this before a text rewrite, which would otherwise mangle a binary

### `dybatpho::create_temp_dir`

- The directory is removed with its contents when the shell exits

### `__dybatpho_file_stat`

Read one metadata field of a path across `stat` implementations.

### `__dybatpho_file_resolve`

Follow a symlink chain to the file it ends at.
  Committing a rewrite means renaming a staging file onto the destination,
  which would replace a symlink with a regular file and quietly detach it from
  whatever it pointed at. Resolving first writes through the link instead, so
  a dotfile symlinked into a repository keeps pointing there and the file in
  the repository is the one that changes.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Path to resolve |

- `1`: The symlink chain is too deep to be a valid one


---

### `__dybatpho_file_staging`

Print the path of a staging file next to a destination.
  The staging file has to share a directory with the destination, because
  `mv` is only atomic within one filesystem.

**🧾 Arguments**

| `$1` | string | Destination path |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Staging file path


---

### `__dybatpho_file_discard`

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Staging file path |


---

### `__dybatpho_file_operand`

Render a path that is safe to pass to a command that does not
  understand `--`. The BSD versions of `chmod`, `chown`, and `sed` on macOS
  treat `--` as a file name rather than as the end of the options, so a path
  that could be read as an option is prefixed with `./` instead.

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Path |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The path, prefixed with `./` when it starts with a dash


---

### `__dybatpho_file_commit`

Move a staging file onto its destination, carrying the
  destination's mode and owner over first so that the rename does not change
  how the file is accessed.

| `$2` | string | Destination path |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The staging file cannot be moved into place

Write standard input to a file through a staging file, so that
  readers see either the previous contents or the complete new contents.

**🧪 Examples**

```bash
printf 'port = 8080\n' | dybatpho::file_write_atomic "${HOME}/.config/app.ini"

```

```bash
dybatpho::file_write_atomic "./config.json" << 'EOF'
{ "debug": false }
EOF

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Destination file path |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The destination directory is missing or the write fails


---

### `__dybatpho_file_sed_delimiter`

| **`DYBATPHO_FILE_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`** | string | When true-like, the default, write through a symlink rather than replacing it |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The file is missing, `sed` fails, or no delimiter can be chosen


---

### `dybatpho::file_ensure_line`

Append a line to a file unless the exact line is already there.
  Running it again changes nothing, which makes it safe for scripts that
  maintain a dotfile across repeated runs.

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The write fails


---

### `dybatpho::file_hash`

Print the checksum of a file.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
checksum="$(dybatpho::file_hash "./release.tar.gz")"
dybatpho::file_hash "./release.tar.gz" sha512

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The file is missing, the algorithm is unknown, or no checksum tool is installed


---

### `dybatpho::file_size`

Print the size of a file in bytes.

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `$1` | string | Optional application name appended to the directory |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`XDG_DATA_HOME`** | string | Base data directory, default is `~/.local/share` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The data directory

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Neither `XDG_DATA_HOME` nor `HOME` is set


---

### `dybatpho::xdg_state_dir`

Print the directory a program's state belongs in.
  State is what a program wants back on the next run but should not be backed
  up, such as logs and history, which is what separates it from data.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
state="$(dybatpho::ensure_dir "$(dybatpho::xdg_state_dir myapp)")"
printf '%s\n' "${run_id}" | dybatpho::file_write_atomic "${state}/last-run"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Optional application name appended to the directory |

**🌍 Environment variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`XDG_STATE_HOME`** | string | Base state directory, default is `~/.local/state` |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- The state directory

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: Neither `XDG_STATE_HOME` nor `HOME` is set


---

### `dybatpho::file_mtime`

Print when a file was last modified, as a Unix timestamp.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
modified="$(dybatpho::file_mtime "${cache}")"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | File path |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Modification time in seconds since the epoch

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The file is missing or its modification time cannot be read


---

### `dybatpho::dir_size`

Print the total size of the regular files in a directory tree.
  The result is the sum of the files' sizes rather than the disk space they
  occupy, so it matches `dybatpho::file_size` instead of `du`, whose block
  accounting and flags differ between platforms.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
bytes="$(dybatpho::dir_size ./build)"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Directory path |

**📤 Output on stdout**

- Total size in bytes, `0` for a directory holding no files

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `1`: The directory is missing


---

### `dybatpho::file_is_binary`

Return success when a file looks like binary rather than text.
  A NUL byte in the first block is the signal `grep` and `git` use, and it is
  what makes a file unsafe to pass through line-oriented tools.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
if dybatpho::file_is_binary "${path}"; then
  dybatpho::warn "Refusing to rewrite ${path}"
else
  dybatpho::file_replace "${path}" 'old' 'new'
fi

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | File path |

**🚦 Exit codes**

- `0`: The file contains a NUL byte in its first block
- `1`: The file looks like text, or is empty


---

### `dybatpho::create_temp_dir`

Create a temporary directory and register it for cleanup on shell exit.
  This is `dybatpho::create_temp` with the argument that asks for a directory
  already supplied, because passing `/` as an extension reads like a mistake.

**🧪 Example**

```bash
local workdir
dybatpho::create_temp_dir workdir "build"
printf 'artifact\n' > "${workdir}/out"

```

**🧾 Arguments**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$1` | string | Variable name that receives the created path |
| `$2` | string | Name prefix, default is `temp` |
| `$3` | string | Parent directory, default is `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` |

**🧩 Variable sets**

- **`The`**: named variable, to the created directory
